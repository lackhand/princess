# Play Agenda

One of you plays the narrator and the others of you play princesses.
You'll work together to have a fun adventure.
* You'll all do this sitting down at a table (or whatever, you do you), rolling dice, and having a conversation to tell a story together:
  * If something bothers you, say it! If someone's bothered, help resolve it!
  * If something delights you, say it! If someone's delighted, keep it going!
  * Everyone's here to have a good time. Be _bold_! Be _curious_! Be _true_! Above all: be _kind_!
  * Before play starts in earnest, you'll all write down the _genre_ together to set some expectations.
* Each princess' player (also called a princess) is an actor, writer, and fan club for her character (and the others!). Not a passive viewer.
  * Be _kind_: Share the spotlight! Yes-and! Share things! Pick up the slack!
  * Be _bold_: Act! Verb! Get into trouble! Fail! Change the world!
  * Be _curious_: Take an interest! Investigate! Try out your character's feelings! Play to find out!
  * Be _true_: Make your princess compelling. Make her passionate! Vulnerable! Strange! Real! Afraid! Admirable!
* The narrator is an umpire, stage crew, janitor, and emcee. Not a writer.
  * Be _kind_: Be fair! Be a fan of everyone! Foreshadow threats! Celebrate successes! Leave hooks everywhere!
  * Be _bold_: Cut to the action! Find the challenges! Find interesting obstacles! Keep the pressure on!
  * Be _curious_: Don't plan. Ask a lot of questions! Difficult ones! Pointed ones! Play to find out!
  * Be _true_: Make the world compelling! Play to the genre! React! Callback to what we learn!

> Every player except for the narrator is a princess in this game, though you can call it whatever you'd like;
> you're all here to have fun and to tell an exciting story.
> The player agenda (and other rules) are guidelines to help that happen, but are no substitute for talking things out as players and as friends.
> For example, your table could use [safety tools](https://slyflourish.com/safety_tools.html).

# Conversation

At the beginning of the session, the narrator establishes the scene:
> There's a new spa in town, and you feel a dark energy emanating from it...

It's good practice to make that hook juicy and personal:
> ... because of the creepy grin Auntie Mo gave you when she showed you all the flyer...

And of course it's always good practice for the narrator ask questions!
> ... so, what do you do to investigate it?

The princesses move the story from there by acting:
they do things and they say things and they feel things.

Interesting things.

Things we'd want to watch on the TV series we're constructing.
Things that make the world react.

It's okay for a princess' player to just ask for clarification! For instance, a princess might ask:
> Wait, who's Mo again?

if she just forgot.
And it's totally fine that she might need to know that, and the table should answer it, it's just a conversation!
It's even better to engage, even if it doesn't immediately change the world:
> Oo, Auntie Mo, thank you! What was the spa like? You're positively radiant!

But it's not like you have to deliver dialog in person. Your table might prefer:
> Oh, I guess she's been? I ask her what the spa was like!

Go with whatever you enjoy & that works for your table.

The narrator should absolutely play that conversation out since it's a chance to add foreshadowing.
But she should also remember to be bold and, if this doesn't lead anywhere, to cut to the action.
> I wanna sneak in, posing as a reporter!

Or, even better:
> I sneak in, posing as a reporter!

And then the narrator moves the story from there, and things repeat!

# Actions

It's best when the narrator is _curious_, prompting and asking questions of the princesses.

It's best when the princesses are _bold_, doing and saying and feeling things which cause changes in the world.

It's everyone's job to help the princesses to turn the clarification question _is it locked?_ into the investigative action _I try the handle_.

_Breaking down crying_ is an action! _Hoping_ might be an action, in the right context!

If everyone agrees about what happens next, then that's great, play can continue (perhaps with the narrator asking a question).
If there's a disagreement, well, that's why that section is there.

# Favor & other resources

Princesses are special, since they're the center of the story.
To help her along, each princess has a supply of **favor** (a metagame resource and combination of luck, strength, grace, patience, and willpower).
There might be other resources (individual or shared) reflecting something true in the fiction, like time or money or **trouble** or even **experience**.

Spending an appropriate resource is one way for a princess to smooth over disagreement: it might be too convenient for Ami to pick the lock for free, but what if it took her a clock-tick of time?
**Favor** is pretty universal, though:
if a princess offers **favor**, she's signaling that something is important to her, and everyone should recognize that!

# Decrees & Memories

Authorship is hard.

Some genres prefer that the narrator determines if someone is actually the long-lost lover of a princess.

Some genres prefer that the mechanics of finding a secret passage determine the presence of a secret passage.

Some genres prefer that a 3/4" socketwrench be declared "packed" before beginning the heist.

Others... don't!

When a princess declares something in the fiction that isn't her own action in the current scene, it's called a **decree**.
It's sort of acting like the narrator.
It's still a part of the conversation.
It can still prompt disagreements, which can be particularly difficult to resolve!

**Memories** are a special kind of **decree**, which describe actions (or scenes!) that the princess could have taken in the fiction in a previous scene.
You can just pause the current scene while you figure out what really happened during the **memory**, and then resume the current scene with your new shared understanding.
The out-of-order play does raise questions over whether the princess would really have known then what she knows now.
One easy solution is to impose a **cost** in **favor**!

> **Decrees** can make the world feel less real, so definitely let the _genre_ be your guide to using them!

# Disagreement

When there's any question of (or disagreement about) what happens next in the fiction, start with discussion and resolve it as a table
(narrator, remember to mediate and ask questions!).
The princess should clarify her _approach_ and _goal_, while the narrator should clarify the **costs**, **risks** or **consequences**, and expected **effects**.
Disagreement is really resolved by the whole table, so a good narrator could ask a question to see if anyone has good ideas for what should happen next.
The princess might spend a resource (often **favor**), or turn to the dice to find out what happens next.

There are no specific rules for how to resolve disagreement between princesses, or how to keep the story coherent with the genre.
Resolve those questions as players before turning to these mechanics!

> If the narrator moves too quickly (& forgets to foreshadow a threat), princesses might feel antagonized or betrayed.
> If they move too slowly or are stingy with resolution, princesses might feel impatient or cheated.
> Keep things moving, exciting, challenging, and in-genre!
