For infrastructural reasons, it's written in an unholy mishmash of:
- kramdown (for class, definition list, & table support)
- liquid (jekyll's templating language, for things like injecting titles & generating anchors)
- liquid-generated-kramdown (sitenav esp in [index.md](./index.md) )
- html/scss templates (well obviously)

If you'd like to contribute, drop me a pull request or bug or fork or whatever!

Please have fun!

# TODO
- Character advancement & currency feel unclear (blink & you'll miss it)
