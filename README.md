For infrastructural reasons, it's written in an unholy mishmash of:
- kramdown (for class, definition list, & table support)
- liquid (jekyll's templating language, for things like injecting titles & generating anchors)
- liquid-generated-kramdown (sitenav esp in [index.md](./index.md) )
- html/scss templates (well obviously)

If you'd like to contribute, drop me a pull request or bug or fork or whatever!

Please have fun!

# TODO
- The name no longer fits, there's too much in one box
  - "Princess" is absolutely the term for generic anime superheroine antics, but these are specifically alchemical *knights* by analogy with Jedi, and so having two terms ("princess" and "knight") is just weird.
  - Is there anything *there* with the alchemy in the background? I obviously still think so, but Paracelsus would disagree.

# Noodling on title
Princess -> Knight School? Alchemise? The Art of Transmuting Metals? Becoming? Phialname?<-- oh, that's good, keep that.
