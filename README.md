  <summary>Programmer details</summary>

For infrastructural reasons, it's written in an unholy mishmash of:
- kramdown (for class, definition list, & table support)
- liquid (jekyll's templating language, for things like injecting titles & generating anchors)
- liquid-generated-kramdown (sitenav esp in [index.md](./index.md) )
- html/scss templates (well obviously)

If you'd like to contribute, drop me a pull request or bug or fork or whatever!

Please have fun!

# TODO
- Trouble and Doom could use some (a lot of) clarification. This is where they get introduced and trouble is half explained and half obvious and half not. And that makes 3 halves which is confusing.
  - Doom is referenced repeatedly but never explained.
- The Dice section... Feels off and I am trying to figure out why/how so as not to give useless feedback
  Maybe the second table needs to go after the second text block (might read better on not a cell phone). And that would make it make more sense.
  Or maybe it is just overexplained for what I need (but I am sure others would need the extra explanation)
  - The actual rules are easy to miss, and probably need more presentation to make the kinds of rolls much clearer.
- Character advancement & currency feel unclear (blink & you'll miss it)
