title: Princess the RPG > Conversation
section: "0.2"
---
This game is played by a group of people holding a conversation.

## Play Agenda

One of you plays the narrator and the others of you play princesses. You'll work together to have a fun adventure.
* You'll all do this sitting down at a table (or whatever, you do you), rolling dice, and having a conversation or telling a story together:
  * If something bothers you, say it! If someone's bothered, help resolve it!
  * If something delights you, say it! If someone's delighted, keep it going!
  * Everyone's here to have a good time. Be bold! Be curious! Be true! Above all: be kind!
  * Before play starts in earnest, you'll all write down the genre together to set some expectations.
* Each princess' player (also called a princess) is an actor, writer, and fan club for her character (and the others!). Not a passive viewer.
  * Be kind: Share the spotlight! Yes-and! Share things! Pick up the slack!
  * Be bold: Act! Verb! Get into trouble! Fail! Change the world!
  * Be curious: Take an interest! Investigate! Try out your character's feelings! Play to find out!
  * Be true: Make your princess compelling. Make her passionate! Vulnerable! Strange! Real! Afraid! Admirable!
* The narrator is an umpire, stage crew, janitor, and emcee. Not a writer.
  * Be kind: Be fair! Be a fan of everyone! Foreshadow threats! Celebrate successes! Leave hooks everywhere!
  * Be bold: Cut to the action! Find the challenges! Find interesting obstacles! Keep the pressure on!
  * Be curious: Don't plan. Ask a lot of questions! Difficult ones! Pointed ones! Play to find out!
  * Be true: Make the world compelling! Play to the genre! React! Callback to what we learn!

## Conversation

At the beginning of the session, the narrator establishes the scene:
> There's a new spa in town, and you feel a dark energy emanating from it...

It's good practice to make that hook juicy and personal:
> ... because of the creepy grin Auntie Mo gave you when she showed you all the flyer...

And of course it's always good practice for the narrator ask questions!
> ... so, what do you do to investigate it?

The princesses move the story from there by acting:
they do things and they say things and they feel things.

Interesting things.

Things we'd want to watch on the TV series we're constructing.
Things that make the world react.

It's okay for a princess' player to just ask for clarification! For instance, a princess might ask:
> Wait, who's Mo again?

if she just forgot.
And it's totally fine that she might need to know that, and the table should answer it, it's just a conversation!
It's even better to engage, even if it doesn't immediately change the world:
> Oo, Auntie Mo, thank you! What was the spa like? You're positively radiant!

But it's not like you have to deliver dialog in person. Your table might prefer:
> Oh, I guess she's been? I ask her what the spa was like!

Go with whatever you enjoy & that works for your table.

The narrator should absolutely play that conversation out since it's a chance to add foreshadowing.
But she should also remember to be bold and, if this doesn't lead anywhere, to cut to the action.
> I wanna sneak in, posing as a reporter!

Or, even better:
> I sneak in, posing as a reporter!

And then the narrator moves the story from there, and things repeat!

Princesses are special, since they're the center of the story.
To help her along, each princess has a supply of favor (a metagame resource and combination of luck, strength, grace, patience, and willpower).
There might be other resources (individual or shared) like time or money or trouble.
The narrator (who doesn't need to keep track of her own resources) can ask a princess to spend favor when she's 

### Actions

It's best when the narrator is curious, prompting and asking questions of the princesses.

It's best when the princesses are bold, doing and saying and feeling things which cause changes in the world.

It's everyone's job to help the princesses to turn the clarification question _is it locked?_ into the investigative action _I try the handle_.

_Breaking down crying_ is an action! _Hoping_ might be an action, in the right context!

If everyone agrees about what happens next, then that's great, play can continue (perhaps with the narrator asking a question).
If there's a disagreement, well, that's why that section is there.

### Decrees & Memories

Authorship is hard.

Some genres prefer that the narrator alone determine if someone is actually the long-lost lover of a princess.

Some genres prefer that the mechanics of finding a secret passage determine the presence of a secret passage.

Some genres prefer that a 3/4" socketwrench be declared "packed" before beginning the heist.

Others... don't!

When a princess declares a something in the fiction that isn't her own action in the current scene, it's called a decree.
It's sort of acting like the narrator.
It's still a part of the conversation.
It can still prompt disagreements, which can be particularly difficult to resolve!
A special kind of decree is a memory, which combines an action (or whole scene that) the princess could have taken with the change that she's not taking it now, but in the past.
Memories are a little easier than other decrees to handle, since the only new wrinkle compared to a usual action is whether the princess would have taken the actions.

> Decrees can make the world feel less real, so definitely let the genre be your guide to using decrees!

### Disagreement

When there's any question of (or disagreement about) what happens next, start with discussion and resolve it as a table
(narrator, remember to mediate and ask questions!).
The princess should clarify her approach and goals, while the narrator should clarify the costs, consequences, risks, and expected effects.
Disagreement is really resolved by the whole table, so a good narrator could ask a question to see if anyone has good ideas for what should happen next.

There are no specific rules for how to resolve disagreement between princesses.
Resolve those as players before turning to mechanics!

> If the narrator moves too quickly (& forgets to foreshadow a threat), it will probably provoke disagreement.
> If they move too slowly or are stingy with resolution, princesses might feel impatient or cheated.
> It's good form for her to find the right number of risk rolls with interesting stakes and to use the resulting consequences for dramatic stakes.

> Enforcing your boundaries isn't up for disagreement, and must be resolved as players and friends.
> Use your words and then update the genre with your new understanding of each other.
