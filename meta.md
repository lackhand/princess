Princess is a roleplaying game of magical-girl melodrama.

I consider it rules-moderate, in the same vein as Lady Blackbird
(, The Shadow of Yesterday, Blades in the Dark, Lasers & Feelings, Fate Accelerated, Dungeons & Dragons, ...).

You know what this is: Something that would play on the CW or Crunchyroll or in an opera-house or at your dining table.

Something about love and loss and heroism and change and growth and destiny.

Something that hasn't been cynicism- & irony-poisoned yet.

Something where violence resolves things cleanly, and where dreams can real.

Something where one brave word breaks the night and, in the name of the moon, triumphs over evil.

Please enjoy!
