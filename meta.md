Princess is a rules-moderate roleplaying game based off of Lady Blackbird
(, The Shadow of Yesterday, Blades in the Dark, Lasers & Feelings, Fate Accelerated, Dungeons & Dragons, ...),
intended for playing games of magical-girl melodrama.

You know what this is: Something that would play on the CW or Crunchyroll or in an opera-house or at your dining table.

Something about love and loss and heroism and change and growth and destiny.

Something that hasn't been cynicism- & irony-poisoned yet.

Something and where violence resolves things cleanly, and where dreams can real.

Something where one brave word breaks the night and, in the name of the moon, triumphs over evil.

## Design Goals

Or: why should you play this game instead of some other game.

Of course you should play other games! Especially the ones which inspired this one! And others!
But here are some things that this game tries to do which you might enjoy:
* It tells a story first.
  Because the core mechanic is a conversation about a shared fictional world, this is often called fiction-first gaming.
* It gives you tools to tell your story.
  Magic and rules light games are hard to combine, because none of us have intuitions about it.
  Genre expectations might be fuzzy, because "action" and "emotional vulnerability" could go to dark places.
  Heck, passionate characters can have a difficult time meshing at the table.
  This game tries to fix those problems.
* It exhibits modern RPG sensibilities (or at least, my RPG sensibilities).
  The rules should support the theme.
  Dice aren't that interesting, and should keep things moving.
  Short core rules. No spreadsheets. Few traps (sorry).
  Characters should come alive through play.
  Use your words.

Please enjoy!
