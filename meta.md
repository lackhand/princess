Princess is a rules-moderate roleplaying game based off of Lady Blackbird
(, The Shadow of Yesterday, Blades in the Dark, Lasers & Feelings, Fate Accelerated, Dungeons & Dragons, ...),
intended for playing games of magical-girl melodrama.

You know what this is: Something that would play on the CW or Crunchyroll or in an opera-house or at your dining table.

Something about love and loss and heroism and change and growth and destiny.

Something that hasn't been cynicism- & irony-poisoned yet.

Something and where violence resolves things cleanly, and where dreams can real.

Something where one brave word breaks the night and, in the name of the moon, triumphs over evil.

Please enjoy!
