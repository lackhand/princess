The enemy's massed strength is technically independent of the princess' statistics.
But it's convenient to use their **trouble** to describe the massed strength of the enemy; when it wraps around to a changed rank, then the villains have accomplished something major, and they move to quickly consolidate their strength, that is, they become less active.

In other words, you could roll for some event, and then figure out (based on trouble) whether it's a direct attack on the princesses, or a more generic energy harvesting operation.

1. The circus is coming to town, and Ms. Abeni wants to bring you all as thanks! / They're harvesting fear.
2. Study trip to the K-YUT station / They're harvesting attention.
3. Strange Sue is in charge of the youth group / Her houseplants are carnivores.
4. Professor Aki is substituting for ill Professor Lin / Aki is poisoning Lin for career advancement.
5. New bookstore opening up & hiring / addictive coffee.
6. Arbor day! / The trees are also monsters.
