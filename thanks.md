I mentioned in the inspiration my deep gratitude to many games which came before,
a suspicious number of which come from John Harper.

Formally:

In particular, this game considers itself [forged in the dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/licensing); per their advice:

And this game is CC-BY (3.0) itself, to keep the good times rolling.

More importantly, this game wouldn't be possible without all of Team Sadpony, and especially the incredibly supportive K.
Thank you!
