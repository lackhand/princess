<details markdown="1"><summary>Bits of stray thought, names, plots, etc.</summary>

> The Burn (VII) is a disembodied evil force that wants to spread itself, inflaming destructive passion in place of every other thought.
> It's unconscious now, after gorging on Alembic for a thousand thousand years.
> Queen Theophrasta (V) was its high priestess and is reborn from Hannah Coen; she seeks: 1. to awaken the Burn to consciousness in the modern day, 2. to call and bind the spirits of citizens of Alembic for wisdom and gloating, and 3. to avert the Golden Wish by breaking the knights.
> She has already burned the hearts of a coven of warlocks and replaced them with astrals, called the Serene Five.
> Three of them (Tier III: Confesiran, Saleduc and Tramercan) are the mummified warlocks of the Scarlet Circle who resurrected Theophrasta.
> One of them (Sulefilm) was a Scarlet Circle member. He was lost during the summoning when his mansion burned down.
> They're now charged with raising, modifying, and empowering the Burned and expanding The Burn, barely able to leave the Dream themselves.
> (IV) Leogox was Theophrasta's lover Errol Bayes, now a shapeshifting manticora.
> His conversion to a Serene was incomplete, and his heart beats elsewhere.
> He operates Theophrasta's mortal pawns to find Burned candidates, trade ash, amass reagents and other resources, etc.
> He's impatient, ashamed of his condition, and domineering.
> (III) Cordy (nee Arthama Pritti) was an alchemic knight who called herself the Moon Maiden in 1985 until her defeat in 2012.
> Leogox seduced her and Theophrasta bound her to Cordyceptyrant, a fungal jinn (she lives lest she reincarnate free).
> She's searching for Parcel (and other returning knights) using witchtaster serpents and her cordyceptyrus curse to create willing "pod people" who burst into mutations after a limited lifespan.
> She's unrealistic, vindictive, and romantic. She still pines for Leogox, who thinks she's pathetic.

Unused genre/skill breakdown?

A princess with a high tier in a genre is more well-equipped and savvy than one who isn't.
How does this affect her?

* Stunts. How is she at athletics, derring-do, and weaponry? ("action" renamed because of heavy overloading)
* Thrills. How is she at espionage, crime, investigation, and intrigue? ("thriller" or "mystery")
* Nature. How is she with animals, survival, hunting, and self-reliance? ("western", but it isn't only!)
* Science. How is she with near-real or sci-fi technology, engineering, computers, and crafting?
* Romance. How is she at loving & living with friends, family, and foes?
* Weird. How much does she know about magic & monsters fantastic & horrific?
* Culture. How is she at history & art, at interacting with high society and meeting expectations? ("musical", historical, comedy of manners)

A special note on non-genres:
* Drama. Drama is built into the dice engine (only rolling when there are stakes, setting specific tensions).
* Historical. That's just some other genre in fancy dress.
* Animation. That's considered a genre? Come on now.
* Comedy. It's assumed to flow from the players.
  It could be a genre -- skill at dealing with the ridiculous or outrageous; everyone knows when someone's mugging.
  But: no. It might work, I'm not brave enough to try.


* Action (War/military; spy/espionage; martial arts, western shoot 'em up)
  * hybrids: buddycop, +comedy, crime, drama, horror, thriller, scifi, superhero, swashbuckler, disaster 
* Thriller (conspiracy; crime; legal; spy; supernatural; disaster, psychological, techno)
* Western (classic, revisionist/anti, contemporary/neo-, fantasy/space, modern)
* Sci Fi (Space travel, time travel, cerebral science, robot & monster films, disaster & alien invasion)
* Horror (zombie, folk, body, found-footage)
* Romance (historical, romdram, romcom, chickflick, praanormal,)
* Fantasy
* Drama 
* Mystery
* Comedy (slapstick, screwball, parody, black)


* Moon. Thief. Crime.
* Mercury. Scientist. Technology.
* Venus. Courtier. Romance & performance.
* Sun. Artist. Expression & the self.
* Mars. Soldier. Action.
* Jupiter. Priest. Manners & civility.
* Saturn. Laborer. Nature, practicality.

## D&D 5e Equivalents

A lot of gamers think in D&D, so here are some ways to translate.

Anything that's undead can be brought over straight. Undead are gonna undead.
Anything incorporeal, fey, more humane fiends and celestials can be spirits.
Anything that's an monstrosity, dragons, that kind of thing is a chimera; it might politely be referred to as a satyr.
Outsiders like true aberrations, celestials, fiends -- those can all be celestials.

5e proposes tiers of play which don't perfectly align with ours, but can be made to fit.
This system is imperfect.
It doesn't work very well for fey, which tend to be tricky-but-not-fearsome, and so have low (5e) challenge ratings despite their intended magical nature.
It's also not ideal for low level "normal" animals, which suffer by comparison to magical beasts.

# Design Goals

Or: why should you play this game instead of some other game.

Of course you should play other games! Especially the ones which inspired this one! And others!
But here are some things that this game tries to do which you might enjoy:
* It tells a story first.
  Because the core mechanic is a conversation about a shared fictional world, this is often called fiction-first gaming.
* It gives you tools to tell your story.
  Magic and rules light games are hard to combine, because none of us have intuitions about it.
  Genre expectations might be fuzzy, because "action" and "emotional vulnerability" could go to dark places.
  Heck, passionate characters can have a difficult time meshing at the table.
  This game tries to fix those problems.
* It exhibits modern RPG sensibilities (or at least, my RPG sensibilities).
  The rules should support the theme.
  Dice aren't that interesting, and should keep things moving.
  Short core rules. No spreadsheets. Few traps (sorry).
  Characters should come alive through play.
  Use your words.
