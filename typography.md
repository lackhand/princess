There are a few special typographical conventions I've tried to use throughout:

## Author notes

> This is a warning about something to avoid.
{:.warning}

> This is a tip about something to do!
{:.tip}

> Ditto this note!
{:.note}

> This is a play example, rules example, or piece of fiction
{:.example}

> This is a note directly from me, your author, about the purpose of something or my own feelings.
{:.aside}}

## Rules content

A princess' key
: The descriptive text of the key, what it means in the fiction
  : The "hit" term, which should come up several times per session
  : The "break" term, which you have to choose to trigger, and which is quite dramatic

A second key
: ditto
  : ditto
  : ditto
{:.key}

A princess' secret
: The descriptive text of the secret, what it means in the fiction
  : A mechanical benefit of the secret
  : Another mechanical benefit (if any)

Another secret
: ditto
  : ...
{:.secret}

<details><summary>Unnecessarily detailed or technical content (click the affordance!)</summary>

The technology I'm using has trouble with markdown inside details; this _should_ work, but mightn't.

| A table heading | A second table heading |
|---|---|
| Some table data | Some more table data |

Sometimes, definitions will be presented low protocol:

A term : Its definition or description
{:}

But at other times, you'll encounter them looking more like a table:

Another term : Its definition or description
A third term : Its definition or description
A fourth term
: Its definition or description

A fifth term
: You get the idea
{:.dtable}
