Your princess' extraordinary abilities are called gifts.
They work a little bit like another game might use an inventory: an abstract measure of your princess' additional capability.
Any mundane but unusual equipment you have with you is a gift: repair tools, fencing equipment, a disguise, etc.
But so are magical talents like psychic ability!
Each gift burdens your princess either physically (weight and bulk) or metaphysically (detectable magic, karmic load, attitude, witchsign).

You don't need to declare your gifts before an adventure, but you do need to declare your Burden, the total load of gifts you'll ultimately manifest. If it's important, you can also decide how much of your load is physical (the rest is metaphysical).

Each point of load is a handheld object, or a bit more than ten pounds when packed away.

| Burden | Max Load |
|--------|----------|
| None   | 0        |
| Low    | 1        |
| Moderate | 3      |
| Heavy  | 6        |
| Extreme | 10      |

An extremely burdened princess can stagger a few steps, but not otherwise move.

You can increase (or decrease) your burden during an adventure (by physically picking up more objects, cutting loose equipment, or during a scene where you have time to interact with your friends and mentally prepare).

You can make new specific gifts available by purchasing a trait or secret, using _borrow_ or _create_ downtime actions, and depending on genre you may also be able to do these things in a **memory** or **decree**.

#### Mundane Gifts

Anyone could be carrying these staples of the modern world:

| Gift (Load if not 1) | Notes |
|----------------------|-------|
| Weapon or gun        | Bat, knife, hatchet, chain, pistol, slingshot, light crossbow, yoyo, etc |
| Heavy Weapon (2)     | A two-handed weapon like kendo sword, chain, fireaxe, frypan; crossbow or rifle |
| Armor (2/+3 Heavy)   | Protective padding and clothing/and a helmet |
| Spare clothes        | A disguise, high vis vest & clipboard, or fancy outfit |
| Arcane implements (2) | Chalk, incense, crystals, a wand |
| Climbing gear (2)    | Ropes etc |
| Breaking gear (2)    | Hammer, crowbar, drill |
| Entering gear        | Lockpicks, vial of acid, tiny saw |
| Crafts kit           | Sewing, paint, wire, pliers etc |
| Flashlight           | A high-powered maglight, headlamp, etc |
| First aid kit        | Antiseptic & -venom, drugs, gauze, pads, etc |
| Textbook             | Reference volumes on a variety of subjects, school supplies |
| Investigator's kit   | Cameras, a recorder, sample vials, assaying chemicals, etc |

| Smartphone(0)        | Talk, text, etc. Rings, tracks you on lovr, potato camera, and runs out of batteries! |

The below make sense for particular characters to bear, but not just anyone.
Light (0 weight) items cost no load if you decide you have them up front (or weight 1 if you decide you have them later).
Max five items from the below:

| Advanced Gift (Load if not 1) | Notes |
|-------------------------------|-------|
| A _fine_ weapon(+0), gear, kit, implement, etc | +1 quality |
| A _light_ weapon(+-1), etc | Makes it weigh 1 less (possibly weightless) |
| 3 _alchemicals_ (1) | 3 _alchemicals_ of your rank -1 (see that section); _borrow_ for better |
| 1 _relic_           | A _relic_ of your rank or below (see that section); _borrow_ for better |
| 3 doses Drugs (0)    | Make whoeever takes it ingests it I _drugged_ though perhaps able to commune with spirits |

| Survival gear (2)    | Tent, water purification tablets & canteen, gas stove, MREs, etc |

#### Psychic gifts

In the same way that a climbing kit gives you permission to scale a cliff (and perhaps you could even try it without), or a survival kit to spend the night in an inhospitable environment, psychic gifts let you do the same thing.

Similar to Advanced Gifts, selecting psychic gifts are tied to your particular abilities.
Examine your traits when selecting specific gifts, and use them to justify the specific gifts you select.

| Gift (Load if not 1) | Notes |
|----------------------|-------|
| Elemental attack     | Psychic blast, fire ray, telekinesis, etc. |
| Heavy elemental attack | Flaming axe, golden spear, mind crush, waterbending, etc. |
| Elemental defense (2/5) | Mind shield, freezing aura, water wall, etc. |
| Levitate/Fly (1/2)     | Levitate or spiderclimb has to remain near (but not touching) the ground; also phasing, breathe underwater, etc |
| Telepathy            | Intuition, psychic speech, remote sensing |
| Prophecy             | Clairvoyance, mind reading, future sight |
| Akasha               | Gain knowledge and skills thousands have (cooking, martial arts, languages, etc) |
| Psychic medicine     | Remove harm, increasing trouble |

#### Transformation

Lots of princesses have civilian identities and mythical personalities; able to transform into a "battle form".

In your civilian form, consider your gifts (and so on) at -1 tier (because you are hiding your abilities).

If your princesses do transform, she can reevaluate her gifts at that time; by increasing the **trouble** by 1, 2, or 3 points each princess can carry the next higher burden of gifts (0, 1, 3, or 6).

After you transform (if your princess can transform?), you might gain magical-but-otherwise-mundane equipment (like a golden sword); your mundane equipment is left behind, transforms with you, or vanishes until you transform back (your choice).
