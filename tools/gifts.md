Your princess' equipment & extraordinary abilities are called gifts.

Any mundane but unusual equipment you have with you is a gift: repair tools, fencing equipment, a disguise, etc.
But so are magical talents like psychic ability!
Each gift burdens your princess either physically (weight and bulk) or metaphysically (detectable magic, karmic load, attitude, witchsign), or of course both.
Either way, a heavily burdened princess should expect to attract more attention and less slack, and a lightly burdened princess is more likely to evade or skate by challenges, but to perhaps have less ability to cope with the challenges she faces.

Each point of load is a handheld object, or 10-20 pounds when packed away.

| Burden | Max Load |
|--------|----------|
| None   | 0        |
| Low    | 1        |
| Moderate | 2-3    |
| Heavy  | 4-6      |
| Extreme | 6-10    |
| Over   | 10+      |

An _extremely_ burdened princess can move around, but will have a hard time engaging in most adventuring; imagine helping your friends move house.
An _overburdened_ princess is (briefly) carrying something too heavy, and can barely move herself; imagine lifting a personal best at the gym.

The narrator can audit the princess' burden by asking them (particularly at the outset of an adventure or when it's dramatic) what their level of burden actually _is_; she need not specify why it's at that level, but later gifts will fit under (and consume) that limit.
Thereafter, a princess can change her burden during the adventure (by physically picking up more objects, cutting loose equipment, or during a scene where you have time to interact with your friends and mentally prepare).

A princess can make new specific gifts available by purchasing a trait or secret, using _borrow_ or _create_ downtime actions, and depending on genre you may also be able to do these things in a **memory** or **decree**.

# Physical Gifts

Crowbars, bicycles, motorbikes, potato canons, cameras, pies, scarves, bookends, paintings: mundane items.
Anything you could make in shop class or by watching videos online is common.
Anything else (machines, medicines, etc) might need to be researched or require a more advanced workshop and research first.

If you need guidance for purchase difficulties, roughly the more detailed something's name is, the higher tier:
* Single syllable abstract objects -- sword (I), gun (I), car (I), gem (I) -- get you toy versions at best.
  * Of course, you could get an automobile (IV; if "brand new", VI!) or motorbike (III)...
  * Can you get a bike (I) or must you get a bicycle (III)? Bike's probably fine.
* A rapier (II) or longsword (II) are lower tier than a katana (III), bowie knife (III) or bec-de-corbin (IV)
* A piano (III) is about as complex as a saxophone (III) or triangle (III) (consider a chime(I) instead?)

Alternatively, anything a princess habitually carries or uses is at her own **rank**.

Most gifts weigh 1 load.
Anything inconsequential and incidental which anyone should have -- a pen, the clothes they're wearing, housekeys, wallet -- should weigh 0 load; consider the consequences for your game if it were not 0 load.
That doesn't mean an infinite number of them is 0 load.
A change of clothes is 1 load even though the initial clothing is free.
A (working) cell phone is 1 load, too, even though by mass it's no heavier than a wallet.
Anything you'd describe as bulky or heavy (armor, a heavy weapon) weighs 2 load.
A body, a suit of armor, or a chest weighs 5 load.

# Off-brand Gifts

A princess's gifts flow from her _traits_ (including _secrets_).

When she wants something that doesn't really make sense from her _traits_, she can use _downtime actions_ like _borrow_ or _create_ to set up a reason in the fiction for the gift to show up.

# Metaphysical Gifts

Magic powers, magic items, arcane rituals, favors from allies, positive thoughts.
Anything can be modeled as a gift.

The secret is that most _gifts_ are just _traits_ (perhaps "gift fictional traits"), which just act as permissions (picking a lock with a pick) or modify effect and risk (wielding a sword or shield).
