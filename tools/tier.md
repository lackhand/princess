Can a normal person knock down a wall with spaghetti? What if the wall were made of soft cheese? Hard cheese? Boiled spaghetti?
Tier lets us capture our expectations around this and other important questions by assigning each side a magnitude and comparing them against a consistent scale.
For instance, we might say a stone wall was Hardness IV, and the spaghetti Hardness -2.
That's a difference of 6! Very difficult to overcome!
But perhaps soft cheese is merely Hardness -1. That's a difference of 1 level. Still difficult, but probably doable.
We can use this same procedure to answer harder questions too:
can a cat sneak past a security system?
Can our heroes find a cure before the poison sets in?
Can the explosives destroy the locked door?
Can love conquer fear?

Tier is contextual ("size" and "education" and "flammability" could all be measured for the same person, but would usually be different from each other).
By comparing the various tiers involved in a disagreement, we can agree on an effect, risk, and pool, and then let the dice take it from there.

It can always be used to measure things subjectively, for instance:

| Tier | Quality    | Rarity  | Examples    |
|------|------------|---------|-------------|
| -1   | Alone      | Worst   | A small pet |
| 0    | Weak       | Junk    | A dull child |
| I    | Moderate   | Common  | Cook doing taxes |
| II   | Strong     | Uncommon | Mechanic's bike |
| III  | Serious    | Rare    | Town doctor |
| IV   | Superior   | Epic    | An olympian athlete |
| V    | Overwhelming | Legendary | A performing idol |
| VI   | Devastating | Artifact | A superhero |
| VII+ | Peerless | Unprecedented | A demigod |

But tier is exponential, and can also be used to measure objective quantities like size or count:

| Tier | Count | Time       | Size      | Force   |
|------|-------|------------|-----------|---------|
| -1   | 1     | A heartbeat | A shoebox | touch   |
| 0    | 2     | Breath (slow) | A cupboard | shove |
| I    | 3-5   | Breath (held) | A closet | punch  |
| II   | 6-11 | A chore  | A room      | hammer    |
| III  | 12-24 | A movie  | A suite     | sledgehammer |
| IV   | 25-49 | Overnight | A house    | bomb     |
| V    | 50-99 | A weekend | A tower    | cannon   |
| VI   | 100-249 | A week   | A campus    | hurricane |
| VII+ | 250+ | A month+ | A district+ | destruction |

### Tier

As an abstraction, it's ok to talk about an object's overall "tier", its default magnitude in the absence of better information about it.
For non-princess characters and tools and obstacles, define their tier and any traits, and then never look back!

For instance, a normal bathroom door might be tier 0 ("weak"):
not much of a barrier, poor quality, not very flame resistant, lighter weight, etc.
A house in a peaceful village might boast a tier I ("moderate") door,
while an apartment in the bad part of town a tier II ("strong") door
or even tier III ("serious") doors if it had four deadbolts and a reinforced peephole.
The important thing there is that we're not describing a specific aspect of the door at all anymore; we're just describing the door's overall tier in a single number.
You can use the same technique with anything in the game: an obstacle, a tool, a spell, an antagonist, a friend.

Remember, tier describes an object but doesn't dictate it.
If a more specific magnitude makes more sense in the fiction than something's tier, go with that!

There are some built in tiers the game uses:

Obstacles' tiers
: The quality of a goon, barrier, monster, strong wind...

Doom
: The waxing strength of the enemy. A guide for the tier of trouble the princesses can expect.

Harm
: Each harm imposes different debility based on its magnitude.
