When a princess needs to spend **favor** but doesn't have any to spend, she is **traumatized** instead of spending the owed **favor**.
She's temporarily _broken_ (as though harm IV) until the end of the scene.
Once she returns, she's permanently changed by her experience. 

She changes or inverts her dramatic agenda rolls to use new text, selecting a different item each time:

| ~~Agenda~~ | Trauma  | Explanation |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| ~~Kind~~   | Just   | Who does it avenge, and how? |
| ~~Bold~~   | Brash  | Where is the glory? Why you, now? |
| ~~Curious~~ | Canny | How did you prepare for this? |
| ~~True~~  | Zealous | To what faith or vision? |

Once all 4 agendas are rewritten as trauma, your princess retires.

> What about different traumas? Go for it!
> The important thing is that the game can go on with this new trauma.
> For instance, becoming "isolated" is generally bad in a tabletop context; the game relies on playing with other people!
