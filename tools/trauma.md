#### Trauma

When a princess needs to spend favor but doesn't have any to spend, she is "traumatized" instead of spending the owed favor.
She's temporarily broken (as though harm IV) until the end of the scene.
Once she returns, she's permanently changed by her experience. 

She changes or inverts her dramatic agenda rolls to use new text, selecting a different item each time:

| ~~Agenda~~ | Trauma  | Explanation |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| ~~Kind~~   | Just    | Who does it avenge, and how? |
| ~~Bold~~   | Planned | How did you prepare for this? |
| ~~Curious~~ | Driven | What impulse or plan does this forward? |
| ~~True~~   | Zeal    | To what faith or ideal? |

You can substitute alternative traumas, but the important thing is not to violate the player agenda.
Once all 4 agendas are rewritten as trauma, your princess retires.
