These tools exist to keep everyone on the same page and to keep the conversation flowing.
Use them when you want:
* To gamble with the outcome, so that everyone is suprised by what happens next
* To add weight to the fiction, so that everyone can see the drama building
* To keep the princesses grounded, so that their obstacles feel real
* To let us reason about the unreasonable or unfamiliar: magic, loss, the true depths of the human heart

These tools rely on the princess clarifying her approach and goals, and the narrator providing an expected cost, level of effect, and/or level of risk.
Once the princess agrees, she engages with the mechanics, which often involves her rolling dice and announcing their result.
The narrator then describes the outcome.
