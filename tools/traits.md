Traits are salient facts about something in the game.
They're the rules text attached to the object, and as we learn about something, it crystallizes into traits which we can use at the table to give it persistence and weight.
They suggest how a thing is better (or worse) than its magnitude might suggest, its psychology, its specialness.


Fictional Traits
: The most common trait. Useful for princesses and other characters, and as a reminder when figuring out effect or risk.

Harm
: A specific type of fictional trait inflicted as a consequence with additional mechanics.

Keys
: Passions, drives, or foibles. You can never take the same key twice.
  When you fulfill its trigger(s) and choose to do so, you can:
  * Play. Mark 1xp.
  * Break. Get 2 advances. You lose the key forever.

Secrets
: Describe the way that something is peculiar, uncanny, magical, or extraordinary.
  They change the rules in an explicit way.

Sometimes a single trait should have the characteristics of more than one type of trait.
Like "Witch of the Scarlet Crescent" describing a set of skills, a membership which carries duties and goals, and a suite of supernatural abilities.
That's probably three (or more!) separate traits (it's ok if they have similar names)!

> A princess might start with 4 fictional traits, 3 keys, and 2 secrets.
> Non-princesses don't need anything so specific; they just get fictional traits.
