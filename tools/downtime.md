title: Downtime
section: "1.09"
---

Between adventures a princess needs her rest, so that she can rise to face to the next adventure.

Together, the table progresses through the _Trouble_, _Projects_, _Recovery_, _Twist_, and _Hook_ phases.

> Downtime occurs at the edges of the sessions of your game.
>
> Despite how the inspirational media usually begins with slice-of-life and then transitions into superheroics,
> it's easier at the table to begin with heroics, and to end with slice-of-life.
> Since it's cyclical, this isn't really a problem.
>
> Between sessions is also a great time to take a breather and reassess things like the _genre_.
> How's it going?
> Does anything need adjustment?
> Have the princesses grown? Does this need adjustment to their **rank**?

### Trouble

In addition to any **trouble** the princesses gained on-screen, every adventure has fallout.

The narrator should judge how destructive, chaotic, or personally damaging this adventure was to the princesses, giving them points of **trouble** as appropriate.

| None | Low | Standard | High | Extreme |
|------|-----|----------|------|---------|
| 0    | 1   | 2        | 3    | 5       |

If this increases the **trouble** to or past 10, it wraps around to 0 and the princess' **rank** decreases by 1.
What goes wrong? Who's hunting them now? How does someone close to them suffer?

> Princesses can reduce **trouble** using _downtime actions_, but they can't make it run backwards;
> once it spills over, the reduction in **rank** is permanent!
{:.note}

### Projects

Princesses use _projects_ to accomplish non-adventurous things.

Usually, each princess gets 2 _downtime actions_ to spend on her _projects_:
* If the princesses' rank is I or less, she gets 1 _downtime action_.
* If the princess' rank is III or more, she gets 3 _downtime actions_.
* Each princess can take 1 additional _downtime action_ by spending 2 **favor**
  * or add 1d to a _downtime action_ by spending 1 **favor**.

Work
: The princess spends time on a _project_. The number of ticks is determined by an _effect roll_ of an appropriate _approach_:

1-3 Failure
: 1 tick

4-5 Mixed
: 2 ticks

6 Success
: 3 ticks

6,6 Crit
: 5 ticks
{:.dtable}



This could be some public agenda, a personal project, or anything else! For instance:

Duty
: The princess volunteers, patrols, or does repairs to lower the **trouble** clock.
  Note: This can't lower it below 0!

Research
: The princess uses a laboratory, library, or her contacts to gather information, do analysis, or _invent_ something

Prepare & Train
: The princess works on herself, marking a number of ticks of _XP_ towards a specific _advance_
{:.dtable}



Alternatively, she can introduce a new fictional element:

Acquire
: The princess introduces a tool she can construct, a friend she can call in a favor from, etc.
  The **tier** of the introduced thing is an effect roll of the princess' **rank** (too low a tier perhaps unavailable?)
  This could take multiple forms:
  bringing someone on a date, crafting a new tool, borrowing a motorbike, or calling in a favor.

1-3 Failure
: Rank -1

4-5 Mixed
: Rank

6 Success
: Rank +1

6,6 Crit
: Rank +2
{:.dtable}



### Recovery

_Harms_ are gradually removed between adventures, as they're addressed in the fiction.

Once each **downtime**, each princess can make a _recovery_ roll:
* 0d if she cannot spend time recovering or...
* Her **rank** if she spends at least one downtime action receiving treatment for any harm and...
* +1d for favorable healing factors (access to medicines, expert skill, etc)
* +1 effect for each action spent on recovery

The resulting _effect roll_ is the number of treated _harms_ whose tiers she can reduce by 1 (disappearing at 0).

She can't pick any harm which she hasn't addressed.

After recovering harms, each princess also recovers back to 9 **favor** (less any **favor** spent during this **downtime**).

> This healing is rather rapid.
> If you want to have a long-term injury, consider taking a key or a trauma to reflect that.
{:.note}

### Twist

After recovery but before the next adventure is the _Twist_.
This is when the world reacts to everything the princesses have done, as events happen in the background and the enemy maneuvers.

Every agenda that could have its clock modified by the adventure gets (or loses) a tick; the narrator should describe what that means or what changes in the world.
Then she rolls the princess' **rank**, to bring these influences home to the princesses:

1-3
: A friend betrays the princesses or is hurt (by enemy action?).

4-5
: Someone picks a fight with the princesses or their friend (why?).

6
: A nasty rumor starts about the princesses or their friend (who started it? is it true?).

6,6
: Someone unexpected asks the princesses for an inconvenient favor (what will change?).
{:.dtable}



Whatever the result, if it's not interesting to pursue, the princesses can increase the **trouble** by 2 to simply handle it offscreen.

### Hook

After determining the _Twist_, it's time for the next adventure, with the _Hook_.

Maybe the princesses have a plan they already wanted to pursue.
Maybe the _twist_ implies an adventure to save someone, the enemies plans are clear and the next step is to block them, or pursuit of a project requires a field trip.
That's a great _hook_, and the princesses can go do it!

Otherwise, they might turn to the narrator and ask for a _hook_ from her.
That's fine too; that's when the monster of the week pops up, and the princesses need to decide how to deal with it.

You might consider the _trouble_ when describing this _hook_ (and throughout the adventure):

0
: The threat is remote and abstract; the villains are siphoning energy through a day spa.

1-2
: The threat is remote or abstract; the villains are friends with a new student at school.

3-5
: The threat is developing; the villains are unwittingly in a position of power over the princesses.

6-9
: The threat is direct. A monster is rampaging through downtown.
