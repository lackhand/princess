section: "1.1.7"
---

Between adventures a princess needs her rest, so that she can rise to face to the next adventure.

Together, the table progresses through the Trouble, Projects, Recovery, Twist, and Hook phases.

> Downtime occurs between sessions.
>
> Despite how the inspirational media usually begins with slice-of-life and then transitions into superheroics,
> it's easier at the table to begin with heroics, and to end with slice-of-life.
> Since it's cyclical, this isn't really a problem.
>
> Between sessions is also a great time to take a breather and reassess things like the genre.
> How's it going?
> Does anything need adjustment?
> Have the princesses grown, and it's time to reflect that in their rank?
>
> This is also the only way to adjust the doom:
> to have made some permanent change to the relationship between the princesses and their source of trouble.
> Between adventures, if the doom is distracted, misled, or diminished, it might be reduced.
> This requires cleverness, sacrifice, and drama!
{:.note}

### Trouble

Adjust the trouble after the adventure by its level of noise and chaos, picking up 1d per factor and making an effect roll.

If this increases the trouble to or past 10, it wraps around to 0 and the doom increases.

### Projects

Princesses make things happen in the world through Projects.
Usually, each princess gets 2 downtime actions to spend on her projects.
A princess can take an additional action by spending 2 favor, or add 1d to an action by spending 1 favor.

Work
: The princess spends time on a project. The number of ticks is determined by an effect roll.
{:.dtable}



This could be some public agenda, a personal project, etc! For instance:

Duty
: The princess volunteers, patrols, or does repairs to lower the trouble clock.

Research
: The princess uses a laboratory or library to work at invention or analysis

Befriend
: The princess uses a social setting to gather information or contact a friend
{:.dtable}



Alternatively, the action might look more like:

Acquire
: The princess introduces a tool she can construct, a friend she can call in a favor from, etc.
  The tier of the introduced thing is determined by a tier roll (and if not high enough, perhaps it can't be borrowed).
{:.dtable}



This could take multiple forms:
bringing someone on a date, crafting a new tool, borrowing a motorbike, or calling in a favor.

Finally, princesses might spend some time on herself:

Study & Train
: The princess marks an effect roll of XP

Recover
: The princess recovers 1 additional tier of harm during recovery.
{:.dtable}




### Recovery

Chronic harms require time and effort to overcome.

Once each downtime, each princess can make a recovery roll:
* 0d if she cannot spend time recovering or...
* Her rank if she spends some time receiving treatment for any harm and...
* +1d for favorable healing factors (medicines, expert skill, etc)
* +1 effect for each action spent on recovery

The resulting effect roll is the number of chronic harms whose tiers she can reduce by 1 (disappearing at 0).
She can't pick any harm which has a higher tier harm remaining.

> Artemis bravely steps up to the fire breathing chimera unafraid, and faces the consequences.
> Everyone agrees that this is a Harm IV "Burned to a crisp", but Artemis' player dissents:
> even without cover, she's a lithe cookie and would dodge the worst of the heat.
> That still seems really bad, but it's lowered to an acute Harm III "Badly Burned" and she needs to spend a Danger roll of favor (she ends up spending 2 favor).
> Once Rei chases off the dragon, Ami checks in on Artemis who'd been hanging back.
> Artemis wants to attempt recovery, so she rolls her Danger again (since she's recovering from a physical injury).
> This time, she gets to add +1d for Ami's first aid kit, and +1d for Ami's secret medical training quality.
> It's reduced to Harm II "Bandaged burns"; it also becomes chronic and costs Artemis another 1 favor based on her roll.
> Even if Ami hadn't given her first aid, it still would have become chronic.
> Finally, the princesses take some well deserved R&R.
> Artemis rolls her recovery roll, and gets an unfortunate 1. She can reduce her Harm II to a Harm I "healing scald", but can't go any further.
> If she'd gotten a 2, she could have removed the Harm II entirely; if she'd had other injuries, she could split the levels of result between them.
{:.example}

After recovering harms, each princess also recovers back to 9 favor (less any favor spent during this downtime).

> This healing is rather rapid.
> If you want to have a long-term injury, consider a key or a trauma to reflect that.
{:.note}

### Twist

After recovery but before the next adventure is the Twist.
This is when the world reacts to everything the princesses have done, as events happen in the background and the enemy maneuvers.

Every agenda that could have its clock modified by the adventure gets (or loses) a tick; the narrator should describe what that means or what happens.
Then she chooses or rolls doom, to bring these influences home to the princesses:

1-3 : A friend betrays the princesses or is hurt (by enemy action?).
4-5 : Someone picks a fight with the princesses or their friend (why?).
6   : A nasty rumor starts about the princesses or their friend (who started it? is it true?).
6,6 : Someone unexpected asks the princesses for an inconvenient favor (what will change?).
{:.dtable}




Whatever the result, if it's not interesting to pursue, the princesses can increase the trouble by the doom + 1 to handle it offscreen.

### Hook

After determining the Twist, it's time for the next adventure.

Maybe the princesses have a plan they want to pursue.
Maybe the twist implies an adventure to save someone, the enemies plans are clear and the next step is to block them, or pursuit of a project requires a field trip.
That's a great hook, and the princesses can go do it!

Otherwise, they might turn to the narrator and ask for a hook from her.
That's fine too; that's when the monster of the week pops up, and the princesses need to decide how to deal with it.

You might consider the trouble when describing this hook (and throughout the adventure):

0-1 : The threat is remote and abstract; the villains are siphoning energy through a day spa.
2-3 : The threat is remote or abstract; the villains are friends with a new student at school.
4-6 : The threat is developing; the villains are unwittingly in a position of power over the princesses.
7-9 : The threat is direct. A monster is rampaging through downtown.
