title: Counters & Clocks
section: "1.1.1"
---

More flexible than a tier, a counter is a publicly visible gauge of something in the fiction.

They're used for pacing and continuity: everyone can see the counters accruing or time slipping away or whatever.
Different physical counters will feel differently at the table: poker chips or tally marks, counting up versus counting down, filling a circle or emptying it.
But they all work the same way; see what works for you and your table.
Fiction comes first! This is just a way to quantize incremental progress.

It's common to call counters that foreshadow an effect when they fill a "clock", and to maintain it in public with a label to remind us what it portends (the obstacle or change, not the method!).
They should trigger (full, empty, or both) when the fiction reaches a critical point and changes, which might overcome an obstacle, change it, introduce a new one, or so forth.
A simple progression might use a 1-clock, a complex one a 4-clock, a more complicated one a 6-clock, or a daunting one an 8+-clock.

Favor
: Princesses spend this counter as a resource to decree, dissent, push, help, and more.
  When it runs out, she acquires Trauma.

XP
: Princesses acquire this resource by acting in accordance with their keys.

Advance
: A princess acquires an advance by spending 5 XP (at any time), or breaking a key for 2 advances.
  She can spend 1 advance to add 1 trait in a way that makes sense to the table.

Trouble
: There's just one Trouble counter, and every time it would hit 10, it wraps around and increases the Doom instead.
  Doom and trouble together set peoples' tone.
  
Time (var)
: During an adventure, time is always ticking until the patrol comes back, the sun comes up, the window of opportunity closes.

Project
: During downtime, princesses & others pursue their works.

### Costs

Counters & clocks make a great cost to make a princess' action more palatable.

For instance, if the genre allows decrees, imposing a cost in favor (or trouble) can make a memory or decree more plausible.
If an action should have a cost in time or trouble, it could be threatened as a risk outcome from a roll, but sometimes it makes more sense to impose it as a fixed 1-tick cost (such as during downtime).

After each session, villainous schemes might develop by one tick.
