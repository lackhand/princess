title: Counters & Clocks
section: "1.1.1"
---

A counter is a publicly visible gauge of something in the fiction.

They're used for pacing and continuity: everyone can see the counters accruing or time slipping away or whatever.
Different physical counters will feel differently at the table: poker chips or tally marks, counting up versus counting down, filling a circle or emptying it.
But they all work the same way; see what works for you and your table and your circumstance.
Fiction comes first! This is just a way to quantize incremental progress.

It's common to call counters that foreshadow an effect when they fill a _clock_, and to maintain it in public with a label to remind us what it portends (the obstacle or change, not the method!).
They should trigger (full, empty, or both; whatever makes sense) when the fiction reaches a critical point and changes, which might overcome an obstacle, change it, introduce a new one, or so forth.
The narrator is in charge of creating new _clocks_ and describing their size or complexity.
A simple progression might use a 1-clock, a complex one a 4-clock, a more complicated one a 6-clock, or a daunting one an 8+-clock.

Favor
: Princesses spend this counter as a resource to **decree**, **defy**, _push_, _help_, and more.
  When it runs out, she acquires **Trauma**.

XP
: Princesses acquire this resource by acting in accordance with their _keys_.

Advance
: A princess acquires an advance by spending 5 **XP** (at any time), or _breaking_ a _key_ for 2 **advances**.
  She can spend 1 **advance** to add 1 _trait_ in a way that makes sense to the table.

Trouble
: There's just one **Trouble** counter, and every time it would hit 10, it wraps around and decreases the princess' **Rank** (which makes lots of things harder for them!).
  
Time (var)
: During an adventure, time is always ticking: until the patrol comes back, the sun comes up, the window of opportunity closes.

Project
: During **downtime**, princesses & others pursue long term goals.

It's common for the narrator to have dozens of clocks going at once.
For instance, there might be multiple clocks in a single scene
(an 8-clock "spirit demon exorcised",
vs a 4-clock automatically ticked after each action "host assimilated",
vs an omnipresent 4-clock "the room catches fire"...);
there might be a couple of adventure-scale clocks
("assassin finds us", "guards go to red alert", "ship leaves", "murderer escapes", "rocks fall"),
or longer-term session clocks ("stars align", "enemy finds next victim", "new tower built", "")

### Costs

Counters & clocks make a great way to increase the palatibility of a princess' actions.

For instance, imposing a **cost** in **favor** balances out a somewhat implausible **memory**; this can also work with other **decrees** (or other resources, like **trouble**!).
If an action should have a cost in time or **trouble**, it could be threatened as a **risk** outcome from a roll, but sometimes it makes more sense to impose it as a fixed 1-tick cost (such as during **downtime**).

After each session, villainous schemes might develop by one tick.
