It's pretty common that an agile fenging princess faces off against an axe-wielding bruiser, or a wild ronin against a controlled samurai, or a village against marauders, or an army against a dragon, or a knight against a dragon.

Of course the purpose of such a scene is to weigh their philosophies against each other, but tactically: who should win?

You can just decide by playing it out with effect, cost, and risk rolls.
But if the narrator wants a little more guidance...

# Initiative

> I wanna run up and kick the soldier with the spear!
> Nuh-uh! She stabs you first!
> Nuh-*uh*! I'm too quick! She doesn't even get to try!

The side with initiative is active, and the side without it is reactive; even if that means a princess is stuck on the back foot, using her actions to respond to what's going on.

The side with longer practical reach or speed has the initiative, and keeps it until they lose it.
If one side is unaware of the other, they can't have the initiative ("surprise").

For instance, if the princess wants to punch a firebreathing troll, she'll need to brave the troll's breath before her fists could ever connect. Once she's dodged that breath, though, she'll be inside the troll's reach and have the initiative herself, until the situation is again altered.

If in doubt, you could make a _fortune_ roll for each side ("roll for initiative"), giving initiative to the higher (princesses win ties).
You could flipflop initiative based on a (short!) clock of the same length.

So: The guard with the spear probably does get to stab first, but Serena will hopefully be too fast to get skewered.

# Damage Types & Potency

> My fireball melts the ice genie!  
> Nuh-uh! The ice genie's water magic snuffs out your fireball!  
> Nuh-*uh*! The fireball turns the water into steam!

Damage types are based on the effect they have on (most) matter.

Hit
Falls, weapons, smothering, sonic or force effects
: Pushes, trips, pierces

Burn
Flames, holy light, lasers or magma
: Burns, softens or melts; sets fires

Decay
Erosion, acid, poison, diseases
: Weakens, rusts, rots; blooms

Freeze
Frost, exposure, shadow, or petrification
: Exhausts, slows, hardens, makes brittle

Zap
Lightning, radiation, stun- or death- rays
: Numbs, conducts, magnetizes; sets fires

{:.dtable}



* All else equal, _burn_ beats _freeze_ (thaws it) beats _decay_ (halts it) beats _burn_ (dampens it).
* All else equal, _decay_ beats _hit_ (erosion) beats _zap_ (grounding) beats _decay_ (purges it).

## Object Examples

| Substance | Quality | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Cloth, paper, rope | -1 | reactive |
| Crystal, glass, ice | 0 | inert |
| Mud, plaster | II   |       |
| Ceramic   | II      | inert |
| Silver, etc | II    | conductive |
| Leather, wood, bone | II | reactive |
| Stone     | III     | inert |
| Steel     | IV      | conductive |
| Mithral   | V       | conductive |
| Adamant   | VI      | inert |

* Quality here measures hardness against the damage types.
* _Hit_ doesn't harm anything _flexible_ like cloth, or liquids or gasses (but might disrupt them)
  * _cutting_ hits do hurt _flexible_ things
* _Reactive_ materials' quality is -1 against burn, decay, freeze, and zap. They might catch fire.
* _Inert_ materials' quality is +1 against burn, decay, freeze, and zap. It's QVI against decay.
  * Ice is Q0 against burn
* _Conductive_ materials (like metals or fluids) conduct freeze and zap to anyone touching them (or if engineered, the ground)
  * Gold is QVI against decay.

So: Rei's Fireball will melt the ice genie, but be neutral against a thunder spirit, and ineffective against an acid elemental.

# Wheel of Stances

> Naturally, you must suspect me to attack with Capa Ferro?
> Naturally, but I find that Thibault cancels out Capa Ferro. Donâ€™t you?

All else equal, the overall level of aggression and tactics determine the combatants' _stance_, and each _stance_ defeats the following stance similar to the elemental wheel (granting _potency_ on a roll):

| _Stance_  | Balanced | Aggressive | Guarded   |
|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Strong vs | Aggressive | Guarded | Balanced |
| Weak vs   | Guarded | Balanced | Aggressive |
| When same | Neutral  | High risk & effect | Low risk & effect |
| Weapon    | Sword, whip | Hammer, axe | Spear, rapier |
| Missile   | Beam, gout | Blast, wave, cloud | Dart, bolt |
| Beast     | Claw, ambush | Bite, pounce, trample | Tail, spines, scales |
| Tactic    | Horse, skirmishers | Archers, engines | Pike, emplacements |
{:.tablecol}

"When same" is guidance when two equally matched opponents fight.
For instance, a pair of crossed rapiers (fairly guarded weapons on this scale) result in low risk and effect for both combatants; arm one of them with an axe and their aggressive stance gives them potency (and so high effect and standard risk); arm the other with an another axe, and the evenly matched combatants are both at high effect _and_ high risk.

Remember, we're doing this to establish _potency_.
A noncombatant or ill-equipped combatant likely lacks _potency_ and also probably _quality_.

The other rows are examples of what _weapons_, _missiles_, _beast_ attack routines or army _tactics_ might match which stance.
For instance, if Serena is commanding an army of pegasus-archers and has them engage Diamande's pikemen, then Serena's archers have the advantage.
If Makoto uses an axe against a scorpion, she should expect the advantage (once inside its reach).
A single hero with a bow or a spear operates very differently from an army with equivalent weapons!

## Duels: Attacks & Defenses

For _duels_, each combatant decides on an independent _attack_ and _defense_ mode secretly and seperately before openly declaring their action, and then reveals them simultaneously while declaring their intent.
Comparing the attacker's _attack_ to the defender's _defense_ sets the level of _effect_, while the attacker's _defense_ to the defender's _attack_ sets the level of _risk_:

| Attack    | Fluid    | Heavy      | Thrust    |
|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Defense   | Evade    | Press      | Block     |
|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| As stance | Balanced | Aggressive | Defensive |

# Advanced Combat and Tactics 2

* Combatants might spend points of initiative instead of favor to defy
* Asymmetric weaponry might adjust the effect or risk for the combatants before considering attack and defense modes
* Combatants might (mutually, secretly) need to declare attacks or defenses they cannot use for 2 rounds
* Combinations of attack or defense might cost initiative
