Can a normal person knock down a wall by using a piece of dry spaghetti?
What about a wall made of cheese? **Soft** cheese?

**Tier** lets us capture our expectations around this and other important questions by estimating scale.
Numbers are useful: you can compare them, or pick up that many dice.
The other tools will make use **tier** in specific ways; for now, let's talk about how to measure it.

We might say a stone wall was Hardness III, and the spaghetti Hardness -2.
That's a difference of 5! A big number! Very difficult to overcome!

But perhaps a soft cheese wall is merely Hardness -1.
That sounds doable, and only has a difference of 1 so it's hard but possible.

We can use this same procedure to answer harder questions too:
* Can a cat sneak past a security system?
* Can our heroes find a cure before the poison sets in?
* Can the explosives destroy the locked door?
* Can love conquer fear?

**Tier** is contextual ("size" and "education" and "flammability" could all be measured for the same person, but would usually be different from each other).
By comparing the various **tiers** involved in a disagreement, we can agree on an **effect**, **risk**, and pool of dice, and then let the dice take it from there.

It can be used to measure things subjectively, for instance:

| Tier | Quality    | Rarity  | Examples    |
|------|------------|---------|-------------|
| -1   | Feeble     | Worst   | A small pet |
| 0    | Weak       | Junk    | A dull child |
| I    | Moderate   | Common  | Cook doing taxes |
| II   | Strong     | Uncommon | Mechanic's bike |
| III  | Serious    | Rare    | Town doctor |
| IV   | Superior   | Epic    | An olympian athlete |
| V    | Overwhelming | Legendary | A performing idol |
| VI   | Devastating | Artifact | A superhero |
| VII+ | Peerless | Unprecedented | A demigod |

But **tier** can also be used to measure objective quantities like size or count (exponentially):

| Tier | Count | Time       | Size      | Force   |
|------|-------|------------|-----------|---------|
| -1   | 1     | A heartbeat | A shoebox | touch  |
| 0    | 2     | Breath (slow) | A cupboard | shove, candle |
| I    | 3-5   | Breath (held) | A closet | punch, torch |
| II   | 6-11 | A chore  | A room      | hammer, gale |
| III  | 12-24 | A movie  | A suite     | sledgehammer, electrical surge |
| IV   | 25-49 | Overnight | A house    | bomb, charging horse, forge |
| V    | 50-99 | A weekend | A tower    | cannon, lightning strike |
| VI   | 100-249 | A week   | A campus    | hurricane, tidal wave, earthquake |
| VII+ | 250+ | A month+ | A district+ | utter devastation |

# Tier as a single number

Even though tier gets used to measure adjectives (harder! Faster! Bigger!) it's ok to talk about an object's (single) **tier** for game purpose abstraction.
For non-princess characters and tools and obstacles, define their **tier** and any traits, and then never look back!

For instance, a normal bathroom door might be tier 0 ("weak"):
not much of a barrier, poor quality, not very flame resistant, lighter weight, etc.
A house in a peaceful village might boast a tier I ("moderate") front door,
while an apartment in the bad part of town a tier II ("strong") front door
or even a tier III ("serious") front door if it had four deadbolts and a reinforced peephole.
The important thing there is that we're not describing any specific aspect of the door; we're just describing the door's overall tier in a single number, and trusting the fiction to fill in any missing details.
You can use the same technique with anything in the game: an obstacle, a tool, a spell, an antagonist, a friend.

Remember, **tier** describes an object but it doesn't dictate the object's qualities.
If a more specific magnitude makes more sense in the fiction than something's **tier**, go with that!
