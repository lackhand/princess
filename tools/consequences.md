After a roll, whatever happens (good and bad) are its consequences.
The narrator uses the fiction as a base from which to interpret the dice result, then she attaches mechanics.

For a mixed or worse result, the narrator can pick as many of the examples of bad consequences below as make sense within the fiction.

A failure has the whole risk and no effect.
A mixed result has the full effect and risk (sometimes, the risk might reduce the effect, but not to 0!).
A success doesn't include any of the risk, and includes all of the effect.
A crit is a success plus something extra (perhaps just +1 effect).

Before learning the consequences but after learning the result of a low risk roll, the princess can choose to withdraw or to press on.
If she withdraws, nothing happens (even if the result was mixed or even a success!); the princess can try a different approach, or else this approach becomes riskier.

After learning the consequences, the princess can dissent against each individual consequence she wishes.

Some examples:

Complication
: Introduce a clock as a threat, or make tier ticks on one. Remember to honor mixed results!
  * Remember, time and trouble clocks are often a good default!
  * Never ever lose favor as a complication; how would she dissent?

Reduced Effect
: (mixed only) Reduce the effect by up to the risk tier (not to 0, though!).

Lost opportunity
: Things change so that your previous approach won't work in the new situation.

Riskier
: Things change so that your previous approach (and those like it) have a higher risk level in the future.

Harm
: The princess is changed in some way from which she will need to recover.

### Dissent

A princess can always dissent each consequence separately.
This allows the narrator to threaten heavy consequences, knowing that if they are too heavy, the princess will be still be able to edit them into palatability.

The narrator decides whether and by how much the consequence is reduced (following the genre conventions).
The narrator decides which attribute the princess should use to make a random cost roll (based on the fiction & the nature of the consequences).
The princess expends the resulting favor (or on a crit, gains that much favor).
Should this remove the princess' last point of favor, see Trauma.

* +1d if the princess has an appropriate tool (like armor against an attack).
* +1d if the princess has the perfect tool (like heavy armor against an attack).

### Protection

A princess can take the consequences for another, if she explains how she substitutes herself.
She can still dissent!

### Harm

Each harm is a trait describing how a princess has been affected by her adventures.
Harm is almost always a consequence (and so a princess can dissent it).
It has a tier (no higher than the tier of the consequence that caused it).

When any of her harms is relevant to a princess, she suffers it & all lower tiers' penalties:

| Tier | Limit | Name | Effect | Example |
|------|-------|------|--------|---------|
| 0    | -     | None | -      | -       |
| I    | 3x    | Minor | Considered for effect | Battered Arm, Drained, Distracted, Scared, Confused, Nauseated |
| II   | 2x    | Moderate | Take -1d when it applies | Exhausted, Deep Cut to Arm, Concussed, Panicked, Seduced, Sick |
| III  | 1x    | Severe | Incapacitated: Actions have no effect level (can get help and push). | Impaled, Broken Leg, Badly Burned, Terrified, Infirm |
| IV+  | 1x    | Critical | Broken: You're taken out until you recover. How are you changed? | Electrocuted, Drowned, Stabbed in the Heart, Dead |
{:.tablecol}

The limits are suggestions at or after which the princess should be facing higher risk than the fiction would otherwise suggest due to her accumulated harm. They're not strict limits, of which there are technically none.

In the scene during which a harm is first inflicted, it's "acute".
After some time passes or the fiction changes, the harm becomes "chronic" (or in the process of recovery).

Non-princesses can suffer harm by just treating them as traits (since they're not actually princesses).

#### Acute Recovery

Different harms require different interventions in the fiction:

First aid
: Physical strain or injury

Study or Preparation
: Deception or understanding

Meditation
: Social, emotional, or magical
{:.dtable}



Once she's addressed a harm in the fiction, she can roll cost with an attribute appropriate to the harm and pay that amount in favor (similar to dissent, but this can never incur trauma).
* If nobody helps, -1d
* Potency (like a first aid kit for an injury), Scale (like an audience to build confidence), and/or quality (the perfect thing): +1d each

If the princess wants to pay the favor, she reduces the harm by one level.

Either way, the harm then becomes chronic; see Downtime to further resolve.

### Consequences in other contexts

The narrator can use consequences whenever she'd like to have something go wrong, because the princesses can use dissent to reject or soften the complication.

For instance, the narrator can use consequences as the cost to take an action or spring them as a surprise, to begin her own action.
The outcome of a threatening clock could be a consequence (not just an inexorable fictional change).

It's good practice to prefer inflicting harm only as a consequence.
