title: Consequences
section: "1.1.4"
---

After a roll, whatever happens (good and bad) are its consequences.

Good consequences are called the effect, and mechanically are ticks on a clock towards some positive change in the fiction.
Bad consequences were foreshadowed by the risk, and are often just called "consequences"; see below for the forms they can take.

|         | None | Low  | Standard | High | Extreme | Explanation |
|---------|------|------|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| Effect  | -    | +1   | +2       | +3   | +5      | How many clock ticks of progress are accomplished towards a goal? |
| Cost    | +1   | -1   | -2       | -3   | -5      | How many clock ticks are lost (or ticked on a bad clock)? |
| Risk    | -    | I    | II       | III  | IV      | What is the max tier of consequences of failure? |

The narrator uses the fiction as a base from which to interpret the dice result, then she attaches mechanics.

### Narrating an effect- or cost-roll

For an effect or cost roll, she merely reads off the number of ticks of effect (or of cost).
For instance, an effect roll that ends up as a mixed result sets the result as standard; a standard effect is worth 2 ticks. Done.

### Narrating a dramatic roll

The narrator had already set the level of effect and of risk before the roll.
After the roll, she's determining exactly how much of each happens.

Mixed or worse
: Pick as many of the examples of negative consequences below as make sense with the fiction.
  After learning the consequences, the princess can defy each individual consequence she wishes.

Mixed or better
: Tick a clock for the level of effect (on a crit, perhaps +1 additional tick?)
{:.dtable}



#### The princess & Low Risk rolls

When a risk is low risk, the princess has an extra option to avoid worsening the situation in addition to normal defiance.

Before learning the consequences but after learning the result of a low risk roll, the princess can choose to withdraw or to press on.
If she withdraws, nothing happens (even if the result was mixed or even a success!); the princess can try a different approach, or else this approach becomes riskier.

### Negative Consequences

Some examples:

Complication
: Introduce a clock as a threat, or make tier ticks on one. Remember to honor mixed results!
  * Remember, time and trouble clocks are often a good default!
  * Never directly target favor as a complication; this would make defiance very weird!

Reduced Effect
: (mixed only) Reduce the effect by up to the risk tier (not to 0, though!).

Lost opportunity
: Things change so that your previous approach won't work in the new situation.

Riskier
: Things change so that your previous approach (and those like it) have a higher risk level in the future.

Harm
: The princess is changed in some way from which she will need to recover.

### Protection

A princess can face the consequences for another, if she explains how she substitutes herself.
She can still use defiance!

### Defiance

A princess uses defiance to defy each consequence separately, reducing or eliminating it.

This allows the narrator to threaten heavy consequences, knowing that if they are too heavy, the princess will be still be able to edit them into palatability.
The narrator decides whether and by how much the consequence is reduced (following the genre conventions).
The narrator decides which attribute the princess should use to make a random cost roll (based on the fiction & the nature of the consequences).
The princess expends the resulting favor (or on a crit, gains that much favor).
Should this remove the princess' last point of favor, see Trauma.

This is just a cost roll, and like any cost roll is adjusted +1d/-1d by the factors of potency, quality, and quantity.


### Harm

Each harm is a trait describing how a princess has been affected by her adventures.
Harm is almost always a consequence (and so a princess can defy it).
It has a tier (no higher than the tier of the consequence that caused it).

When any of her harms is relevant to a princess, she suffers it & all lower tiers' penalties:

| Tier | Limit | Name | Effect | Example |
|------|-------|------|--------|---------|
| 0    | -     | None | -      | -       |
| I    | 3x    | Minor | Considered for effect | Battered Arm, Drained, Distracted, Scared, Confused, Nauseated |
| II   | 2x    | Moderate | Take -1d when it applies | Exhausted, Deep Cut to Arm, Concussed, Panicked, Seduced, Sick |
| III  | 1x    | Severe | Incapacitated: Actions have no effect level (can get help and push). | Impaled, Broken Leg, Badly Burned, Terrified, Infirm |
| IV+  | 1x    | Critical | Broken: You're taken out until you recover. How are you changed? | Electrocuted, Drowned, Stabbed in the Heart, Dead |
{:.tablecol}

The limits are suggestions at or after which the princess should be facing higher risk than the fiction would otherwise suggest due to her accumulated harm. They're not strict limits, of which there are technically none.

In the scene during which a harm is first inflicted, it's "acute".
After some time passes or the fiction changes, the harm becomes "chronic" (or in the process of recovery).

Non-princesses can suffer harm by just treating them as traits.

#### Acute Recovery

Different harms require different interventions in the fiction:

First aid or indulgence
: Physical strain or injury

Ritual or preparation
: Deception or understanding

Reminiscing or discussion
: Social, emotional, or magical
{:.dtable}



Once she's addressed a harm in the fiction (or after the opportunity has passed), she can choose to make a cost roll with the appropriate attribute and pay that amount in favor (similar to defiance) to reduce the harm by one tier.
Either way, the harm then becomes chronic; see Downtime to further resolve.

### Consequences in other contexts

The narrator can use consequences whenever she'd like to have something go wrong, because the princesses can use defiance to reject or soften the complication.

For instance, the narrator can use consequences as the cost to take an action or spring them as a surprise, to begin her own action.
The outcome of a threatening clock could be a consequence (not just an inexorable fictional change).
