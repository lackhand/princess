Dice are a great way to settle a disagreement about what happens next (_dramatic rolls_), to determine the magnitude of an outcome (_effect-_ or _cost-rolls_), or as an oracle to keep the game fresh (_fortune rolls_).

For all of these types of rolls, this game uses pools of various numbers of d6s (notated as `1d` per die, their total number called the pool's "size"), of which the highest resulting face value(s) are read BitD-style:

> If you would roll 0d, roll 2d and discard the highest (you can't _crit_)
{:.warning} 

1-3 _Failure_
: The worst you'd feared!

4-5 _Mixed_
: Some good, some bad

6 _Success_
: All good (no bad!)

6,6 _Crit_
: Even better than you'd hoped!
{:.dtable}



Before she actually rolls, everyone should understand what a success or failure looks like, and afterwards, the narrator uses the result to describe what exactly happened.
