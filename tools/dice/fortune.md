Sometimes you just want to know how something offscreen turns out.

A _fortune roll_ is perfect for settling questions like "is the weather nice today" or "how is mom's mood" or "which horse wins the race" or "did he make it home safely?" or "does the bridge hold?" or similar: the outcome is interesting but not dramatic and there's no princess' action driving the outcome.

The narrator sets the size of the pool by her feeling, and interprets the results afterwards the same way.
If it's a competition between two parties, make a fortune roll for each of them and then interpret the results.
