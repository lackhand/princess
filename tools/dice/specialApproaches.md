Princesses have a few optional rules they can use when rolling dice (if the fiction permits).
These don't make much sense during fortune rolls, but make lots of sense during effect rolls, some cost rolls, and dramatic rolls.

## Teamwork

Everyone tries to do the same thing and picks one leader.
* She explains how she leads.
* Everybody makes the same roll (as they normally would).
* The leader picks one result that applies to everyone.
* The leader pays 1 favor for each _failure_ (1-3) this erases.

## Push yourself

When something is important, it's all on the line, and a princess needs to win, she can become very mighty indeed.
* The princess pays 2 **favor**
* Instead of rolling her attribute, she picks up 0d and adds +1d by answering the following questions for her approach (or goal) and her player agenda:
  * Is this kind (who does it help, and how)? +1d
  * Is this bold (unexpected or awesome)? +1d
  * Is this curious (what could we learn, what exploration does it reward)? +1d
  * Is this true (to herself & the circumstances)? +1d
  * Note: if you've acquired _trauma_, your questions are different.

> Answer the agenda questions out loud!
> It's genre appropriate to externalize your emotions in this way, and it tells us your princess' truth.
> It's not a great idea to use this on passive rolls like _defy_ rolls, where even in the best case, you're already spending 2 **favor** more than you might otherwise...

## Help a friend

During another princess' roll, a princess may pay 1 **favor**, say how they help, and give her +1d.
If there are any **consequences**, she suffers them, too.

Non-princess' help can contribute to **effect** and **risk**, but they can't contribute dice.

## Instigate (out of character)

Whenever a princess rolls, anyone can suggest an unexpected way in which things get more interesting (usually worse).
If everyone agrees, she gets +1d, but the fictional wrinkle comes true, too.
