title: Consequences
section: "1.4.5"
---

After a roll, whatever happens (good and bad) are its **consequences**.

Good **consequences** are called the **effect**, and mechanically are ticks on a clock towards some positive change in the fiction.
Bad **consequences** were foreshadowed by the **risk**, and are often just called "**consequences**"; see below for the forms they can take.

|         | None | Low | Standard | High | Extreme | Explanation |
|---------|------|-----|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Effect** | - | +1 | +2      | +3   | +5    | How many clock ticks of progress are accomplished towards a goal? |
| **Cost** | +1  | -1 | -2      | -3   | -5    | How many clock ticks are lost (or ticked on a bad clock)? |
| **Risk** | -   | I  | II      | III  | IV    | What is the max tier of consequences of failure? |
{:.tablecol}

The narrator uses the fiction as a base from which to interpret the dice result, then she attaches mechanics.

# Narrating an effect- or cost-roll

For an effect- or cost-roll, she merely reads off the number of ticks of **effect** (or of **cost**) for the level on the table.

For instance, an effect roll that ends up as a _mixed result_ sets the result as _standard_; a _standard effect_ is worth 2 ticks. Done.

Cost can result in a refund, or in positive ticks to some other clock!
For instance, a princess that rolls a _crit_ on **defiance** gets 1 **favor** back instead of losing any!

# Narrating a dramatic roll

Remember, the narrator had already set the _level_ of **effect** and of **risk** before the roll.
After the roll, she's determining exactly how much of each happens.

_Mixed_ or worse
: Pick as many of the examples of negative **consequences** below as make sense with the fiction.
  After learning the **consequences**, the princess can **defy** each individual **consequence** she wishes.

_Mixed_ or better
: Tick a _clock_ for the level of **effect** (on a _crit_, perhaps +1 additional tick?)
{:.dtable}



# Negative Consequences

Some examples:

Complication
: Introduce a _clock_ as a threat, or make _risk level_ ticks on one. Remember to honor mixed results!
  * Never directly target **favor** as a **complication**; this would make **defiance** very weird!
  * Examples: "patrol arrives", "intruder alert", "room catches fire", "out of ammunition", etc

Reduced Effect
: (mixed only) Reduce the effect by up to the risk tier (not to 0, though!).

Lost opportunity
: Things change so that your previous approach won't work in the new situation.
  * Examples: Car chase moves to boats; deception is revealed; monster evolves new immunity; lose sight of quarry.

Riskier
: Things change so that your previous approach (and those like it) have a higher risk level in the future.
  * Examples: Brawler grabs weapon; monster evolves new attack; suspicions mount; dangling from rooftop.

Harm
: The princess is changed in some way from which she will need to recover. See below!

# Harm

Each _harm_ is a _trait_ describing how a princess has been affected by her adventures.
_Harm_ is almost always a **consequence** (and so a princess can **defy** it).
It has a _level_ (no higher than the _level_ of the **consequence** that caused it).

When any of her _harms_ is relevant to a princess, she suffers it & all lower _levels_' penalties:

| Level | Limit | Name | Effect | Example |
|------|-------|------|--------|---------|
| 0    | -     | None | -      | -       |
| I    | 3x    | Minor | Considered for _effect level_ | Battered Arm, Drained, Distracted, Scared, Confused, Nauseated |
| II   | 2x    | Moderate | Take -1d when it applies | Exhausted, Deep Cut to Arm, Concussed, Panicked, Seduced, Sick |
| III  | 1x    | Severe | _Incapacitated_: Everything has _effect level none_ (can get _help_ and _push_). | Impaled, Broken Leg, Badly Burned, Terrified, Infirm |
| IV+  | 1x    | Critical | _Broken_: You're taken out until you recover. How are you changed? | Electrocuted, Drowned, Stabbed in the Heart, Dead |
{:.tablecol}

The limits are suggestions at or after which the princess should be facing higher **risk** than the fiction would otherwise suggest due to her accumulated _harm_. They're not strict; go with what makes sense!

Non-princesses can suffer _harm_ by just treating them as _traits_.

# Consequences in other contexts

The narrator can use consequences whenever she'd like to have something go wrong, because the princesses can use defiance to reject or soften the complication.

For instance, the narrator can use consequences as the cost to take an action or spring them as a surprise, to begin her own action.
The outcome of a threatening clock could be a consequence (not just an inexorable fictional change).
