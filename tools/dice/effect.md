Settle questions like "how much" when a princess is involved.

They're perfect for deciding on amount of **effect** or amount of **cost** (thus the name), when the other quantity is not in doubt.
That's pretty common: it happens during **downtime projects**, during **defiance**, opposing obstacles in an adventure which logically need to be overcome but which aren't actually very interesting ("locked doors" or "scaling cliffs").

For an _effect roll_, the narrator sets the **cost** (example: "you spend one downtime action"), and the princess rolls to find out the level of **effect** (", but how much do you accomplish?").
For a _cost roll_, the narrator sets the **effect** ("you climb the cliff"), and the princess rolls to find out the level of **cost** (", but how long does it take you?").

This is similar to a _fortune roll_, but more formalized:

* The pool size is the relevant princess' _attribute_ (the narrator is the final judge)
* +1d/-1d for each factor:

  Potency
  : particularly strong approach (perhaps from preparation?) (or -1d if particularly weak).

  Quality
  : Higher tier tools beat worse-tier obstacles (or -1d if the other way around).

  Quantity
  : (or number, scale, or similar) A fight is easier with allies (or -1d if the princesses are fighting a mob).
    But on the other hand, it's easier for three princesses to slip away into a crowd!

See **consequences** for advice on how to interpret the levels of **effect** or **cost**.

## Dramatic Rolls

During an adventure, many (even most?) rolls are _dramatic rolls_, because they settle disagreements like "what do I lose" and "what do I gain" using a single die roll.
They're similar to effect- or cost-rolls, but randomize both axes.

They're good for chaotic or violent events like combat or for rapidly evolving situations like young love.
The narrator states the level of potential **effect** and **risk** up front using the princess' approach and goals, and the roll determines how much of each actually happens.

* The narrator uses the approach, factors like _potency_, _quality_, & _quantity_, and their judgment to declare the **effect** and **risk** levels ahead of time
* The princess rolls
* The narrator uses **consequences** to interpret the results.

## Adjusting the odds

The narrator and table can consider (before the roll):

* _Swapping_ +1d/effect. Bonus dice from special approaches still count against a princess' 6d limit, but she can choose to set 1 aside unrolled for +effect.
* _Swapping_ effect/risk. If there is a risk, you might agree to exchange risk for effect 1:1 before the roll by being especially aggressive or cautious.
