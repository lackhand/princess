> Wait wait wait. That's not how it happened.

A princess uses **defiance** to **defy** each **consequence** separately, reducing or eliminating it.

This allows the narrator to threaten heavy **consequences**, knowing that if they are too heavy, the princess will be still be able to edit them into palatability.
The narrator decides whether and by how much the **consequence** is reduced (following the _genre_ conventions).
The narrator decides which **attribute** the princess should use to make a random _cost roll_ (based on the fiction & the nature of the **consequences**).
The princess expends the resulting **favor** (or on a _crit_, gains that much **favor**).
Should this remove the princess' last point of **favor**, see **Trauma**.

This is just a _cost roll_, and like any _cost roll_ is adjusted +1d/-1d by the factors of _potency_, _quality_, and _quantity_.
It's worth calling out, because this ability for the narrator to be aggressive in describing things going wrong, and for the princess to litigate them back is very important!

# Defiance & Low Risk rolls

When the **risk** is _low_, the princess has an extra option to avoid worsening the situation: _withdraw_ from a _failure_ or _mixed_ result.

If she decides to _withdraw_, then disregard the **effect** and other **consequences**. Instead, the princess can try a different approach, and repeating this approach becomes riskier.
Unlike normal defiance, this doesn't require a roll or cost any **favor**.

# Protection

A princess can take the **consequences** for another, if she explains how she substitutes herself.
She can then still use **defiance** herself!
