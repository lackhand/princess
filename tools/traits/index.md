_Traits_ are salient facts about something in the game.
They're the notable qualities & rules text attached to the object, and as we learn about something, it crystallizes into _traits_ which we can use at the table to give it persistence and weight.
They suggest how a thing is better (or worse) than its tier might suggest; they encode its psychology, its specialness.

Fictional Traits
: The most common trait. Useful for princesses and other characters, and as a reminder when figuring out _levels of effect_ or _risk_.
  They're true and important things about a character.
  They sometimes work as permissions (_Catseyed_ might see at night; _has wings_ should fly, _soldier_ has military connections), sometimes modify effect (_Strong as an ox_, _mechanical wiz_), risk (_Surefooted_, _Strong stomach_), or combinations (_master thief_ knows how to pick locks, and is good at it!).

Keys
: Passions, drives, or foibles. You can _never_ take the same _key_ twice.
  When you fulfill its trigger(s) and choose to do so, you can:
  * Play it. Mark **1xp**.
  * Break it. Get 2 **advances**. You lose the _key_ forever.

Secrets
: Describe the way in which that something is peculiar, uncanny, magical, or extraordinary.
  They change the rules in an explicit way.

Harm
: A specific type of fictional trait inflicted as a **consequence** (sometimes with additional mechanics).
  Higher levels of harm act a little like Secrets, making things harder.

Sometimes a single _trait_ should have the characteristics of more than one type of trait.
Like "Witch of the Scarlet Crescent" describing a set of skills, a membership which carries duties and goals, and a suite of supernatural abilities.
That's probably three (or more!) separate _traits_ (it's ok if they have similar names)!

# Adding Traits

When a _clock_ completes, this often results in a change in the fiction, which could change one or more traits (When _the room catches fire_, that's certainly salient!).

Examples of this are everywhere: removing a trait like _armed with a sword_ might require a clock _disarmed_ during a duel, _hidden in the stacks_ require a clock _found it!_, and so on.

But there are others, like the princess' own traits; those are purchased 1:1 with _advances_, which can be purchased 1:5 with _xp_ -- and _xp_ is just a clock!

# Designing Keys

Keys are easy: give them a _play_ trigger you expect to come up all of the time in game, and a _break_ trigger which you expect to be very dramatic when they come up.

These are incentives, so make sure you're incentivizing what you'd like to see happen at the table!

# Designing Secrets

In general, secrets should come in a few forms:
* Once per session, resist specific consequences / push self somehow.
* When you X, +1d (& skip one of the agenda questions?)
* Limited +1d/+effect  (often +1d to some other action)
  * Or even +potency, similar to +effect really
* When you _push_ yourself, +specific effects (you still get the normal benefits of pushing yourself)
* You can spend **favor** for an explicitly supernatural ability
* +1 result level to downtime or other low-risk actions (often crafting or other projects)
