Your princess' equipment & extraordinary abilities are called _gifts_.

Most _gifts_ can be treated as _fictional traits_ for evaluating **effect** and **risk** or establishing that a particular action makes sense in the fiction.
Any mundane but unusual equipment you have with you is a gift: repair tools, fencing equipment, a disguise, etc.
But so are magical talents like psychic ability!
Each gift burdens your princess either physically (weight and bulk) or metaphysically (detectable magic, karmic load, attitude, witchsign), or of course both.
A heavily burdened princess should expect to attract more attention and less slack.
A lightly burdened princess is more likely to evade or skate by some challenges, but with less flexibility.

| Burden | Max Load | Physical description |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| Low    | 0-1      | Athletic clothes, revealing clothes. |
| Moderate | 2-3    | Student clothes, streetwear, bike messenger. |
| High   | 4-6      | Trenchcoat, backpack, duffel bag; witchy. |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| Extreme | 7-10    | Can move around, but can't engage in most adventuring; hands full. |
| Over   | 10+      | Can barely move herself! Lifting a personal best at the gym. |
| None   | -1       | Has been searched, prisoner, etc. |

The narrator can audit the princess' burden by asking them (particularly at the outset of an adventure or when it's dramatic) what their level of burden actually _is_; she need not specify why it's at that level, but later gifts will fit under (and consume) that limit.
A princess can change her burden during the adventure (by physically picking up new objects, cutting loose equipment, or through meditation or study.

# Gifts' load

Each point of load is a handheld object, or 10-20 pounds when packed away.

* Most gifts are 1 load.
  * Anything incidental which anyone should have -- a pen, the clothes they're wearing, housekeys, wallet -- should weigh 0 load.
    * A change of clothes is 1 load even though the initial clothing is free
  * Anything you'd describe as bulky or heavy (armor, a heavy weapon) weighs 2 load
  * A body, a suit of armor, or a chest weighs 5 load

## Companions & Powers

For non-object gifts, it's more about the amount of fictional space they take up than their size.

Most (human) companions are 0 load, but often require repayment in **favor**, **trouble**, downtime actions, or whole adventures.
A specialist one-time-only favor during an adventure might require payment of 1 **favor**, **trouble**, or load (like a toy, candy, or a wad of cash).

Most pets & mounts are 0-2 load.
A cherished pet toad might be 0 load, while a mighty steed or trained attack tiger might be 2 load.
Most (a hawk, smellhound, hunting cat, venemous snake, riding goat, tactical turkey, etc) would be 1 load.

Powers, similar to pets & mounts, charge load directly.
* 0 load for powers that aren't that impressive or relevant; dim light vision, super smell
* 1 load for powers that duplicate equipment; fire blasts, water breathing, chameleon skin, dowsing
* 2 load for _good_ powers that duplicate equipment or similar; storm control, super strength; telepathy, danger sense
* 5 load for powers that dictate engagement; crowd/terrain control, phasing, unlimited shapeshifting

# Gifts' tier & quality

Usually, a _gift_ has the same quality as its tier, and no other useful qualities: no real range to speak of, instantaneous duration, etc.

This isn't always true!
A grenade will explode a room-sized area (compare to an equivalent rifle; it's single use), and a rifle will out-range an equivalent sword (it attracts attention, it's loud, it could run out of ammunition or jam, etc).
Follow the fiction.

Similarly, your princess might have _study drug addiction_ (edgy!) or similar; even though those are magically a _potion of wisdom_ tier IV, it's been established as a part of your character, and you retain access.

For estimation, the more detailed something's name is, the higher **tier**:
* Single syllable abstract objects -- sword (I), gun (I), car (I), gem (I) -- get you toy versions at best.
  * Of course, you could get an automobile (IV; if "brand new", VI!) or motorbike (III)...
  * Can you get a bike (I) or must you get a bicycle (III)? Bike's probably fine.
* A rapier (II) or longsword (II) are lower tier than a katana (III), bowie knife (III) or bec-de-corbin (IV)
* A piano (III) is about as complex as a saxophone (III) or triangle (III) (consider a chime(I) instead?)

If a princess wants a gift that doesn't flow immediately from her personal _traits_, she has several options:
* Use an _advance_ to purchase a new _fictional trait_
* Use _borrow_ to get the _gift_ for one session
* Use _invent_ and then _craft_ to permanently add the _gift_
* Find it in the fiction and use it for a time
* Depending on genre, you might be able to do these things in a **memory**!
