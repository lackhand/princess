Dice are a great way to settle a disagreement about what happens next (_dramatic rolls_), to determine the magnitude of an outcome (_effect-_ or _cost-rolls_), or as an oracle to keep the game fresh (_fortune rolls_).

For all of these types of rolls, this game uses pools of various numbers of d6s (notated as `1d` per die, their total number called the pool's "size"), of which the highest resulting face value(s) are read BitD-style:

> If you would roll 0d, roll 2d and discard the highest (you can't _crit_)
{:.warning} 

1-3 _Failure_
: The worst you'd feared!

4-5 _Mixed_
: Some good, some bad

6 _Success_
: All good (no bad!)

6,6 _Crit_
: Even better than you'd hoped!
{:.dtable}



Before she actually rolls, everyone should understand what a success or failure looks like, and afterwards, the narrator uses the result to describe what exactly happened.

### Fortune Rolls

Sometimes you just want to know how something offscreen turns out.

A _fortune roll_ is perfect for settling questions like "is the weather nice today" or "how is mom's mood" or "which horse wins the race" or "did he make it home safely?" or "does the bridge hold?" or similar: the outcome is interesting but not dramatic and there's no princess' action driving the outcome.

The narrator sets the size of the pool by her feeling, and interprets the results afterwards the same way.
If it's a competition between two parties, make a fortune roll for each of them and then interpret the results.

0d
: Baseline. Note that rolling 2d total gives good even odds: 25% chance of failure, 33% chance of success or better.

+1d
: Per major advantage, or per point of **tier**

-1d
: Per major disadvantage

### Effect- and Cost-Rolls

Settle questions like "how much" when a princess is involved.

They're perfect for deciding on amount of **effect** or amount of **cost** (thus the name), when the other quantity is not in doubt.
That's pretty common: it happens during **downtime projects**, during **defiance**, opposing obstacles in an adventure which logically need to be overcome but which aren't actually very interesting ("locked doors" or "scaling cliffs").

For an _effect roll_, the narrator sets the **cost** (example: "you spend one downtime action"), and the princess rolls to find out the level of **effect** (", but how much do you accomplish?").
For a _cost roll_, the narrator sets the **effect** ("you climb the cliff"), and the princess rolls to find out the level of **cost** (", but how long does it take you?").

This is similar to a _fortune roll_, but more formalized:

* The pool size is the relevant princess' _attribute_ (the narrator is the final judge)
* +1d/-1d for each factor:

  Potency
  : particularly strong approach (perhaps from preparation?) (or -1d if particularly weak).

  Quality
  : Higher tier tools beat worse-tier obstacles (or -1d if the other way around).

  Quantity
  : (or number, scale, or similar) A fight is easier with allies (or -1d if the princesses are fighting a mob).
    But on the other hand, it's easier for three princesses to slip away into a crowd!
  {:.dtable}



|              | 1-3  | 4-5      | 6    | 6, 6    |
|--------------|------|----------|------|---------|
| _Effect Level_ | Low  | Standard | High | Extreme |
| _Cost Level_   | High | Standard | Low  | None    |

See **consequences** for advice on how to interpret the levels of **effect** or **cost**.

### Dramatic Rolls

During an adventure, many (even most?) rolls are _dramatic rolls_, because they settle disagreements like "what do I lose" and "what do I gain" using a single die roll.

They're good for chaotic or violent events like combat or for rapidly evolving situations like young love.
They're characterized by having a known **effect** and **risk**, and the roll determining how much of each actually happens.
The narrator states the level of **effect** and **risk** before the roll, using the princess' approach and goals.

This is similar to a fortune roll, but even more formalized:
* The princess picks up 0d, then adds one more for each link between her approach (or goal) and her player agenda:
  * Is this kind (who does it help, and how)? +1d
  * Is this bold (unexpected or awesome)? +1d
  * Is this curious (what could we learn, what exploration does it reward)? +1d
  * Is this true (to herself & the circumstances)? +1d
* The narrator uses the approach, factors like _potency_, _quality_, & _quantity_, and their judgment to declare the **effect** and **risk**
* The princess rolls

See **consequences** for advice on how to read the results.

> Answer the agenda questions out loud!
> It's genre appropriate to externalize your emotions in this way, and it tells us your princess' truth.
{:.tip}

> Can't I just roll an approach?
> Maybe. Yes, I guess. But it's less melodramatic.
> Consider acquiring some trauma to reflect your princess' disconnect and ennui?

### Special Approaches

Princesses have a few optional rules they can use when rolling dice (if the fiction permits).
These don't make much sense during fortune rolls, but make lots of sense during effect rolls, cost rolls, and dramatic rolls.
* _Teamwork_. Everyone tries to do the same thing and picks one leader.
  She explains how she leads.
  Everybody makes the same roll (as they normally would).
  The leader picks one result that applies to everyone.
  The leader pays 1 favor for each failure this erases.
* _Push yourself_. During any roll, a princess may pay 2 favor, try very hard, and get +1d.
* _Help_ a friend. During any friend's roll, a princess may pay 1 favor, say how they help, and give her +1d.
  If there are any consequences, she suffers them, too.  
  Non-princesses can help too in the fiction, which adjusts position and effect.
* _Instigate_ (out of character). Whenever anyone rolls, suggest an unexpected way in which things get more interesting.
  If everyone agrees, she gets +1d, but the fictional wrinkle comes true.
* _Swap_ +1d/effect. Bonus dice from special approaches still count against a princess' 6d limit, but she can choose to set 1 aside unrolled for +effect.
* _Swap_ effect/risk. If there is a risk, you might agree to exchange risk for effect 1:1 before the roll by being especially aggressive or cautious.

All of these require the whole table to agree that they make sense.
