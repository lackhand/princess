This game uses pools of variable numbers of d6s (notated as `1d` per die), of which the highest resulting face value(s) are read BitD-style. 1-3 is a failure, 4-5 a mixed result, 6 a success, and Two or more sixes are a crit.
The number of dice in the pool (also called its "size") is situation dependent: it's +1d per factor in favor of things going well (and sometimes -1d per factor against).
When dice are rolled, the possibilities must be understood before the roll, and interpreted by the narrator after the roll.

> If you would roll 0d, roll 2d and immediately discard the highest. This can't crit.  
> Never roll more than 6d. Any extras are just lost.

|         | 1-3 | 4-5 | 6 | 6, 6 |
|---------|-----|-----|---|------|
| Result  | Failure | Mixed | Success | Crit |
| Meaning | The worst you'd feared! | Some good, some bad | All good (no bad) | Better than you'd hoped! |
| Effect Level | Low  | Standard | High | Extreme |
| Risk/Cost Level | High  | Standard | Low | None |

|         | None | Low  | Standard | High | Extreme | Explanation |
|---------|------|------|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| Effect  | -    | +1   | +2       | +3   | +5      | How many clock ticks of progress are accomplished towards a goal? |
| Cost    | -1   | 1    | 2        | 3    | 5       | How many points or ticks are spent towards a goal? |
| Risk    | -    | I    | II       | III  | IV      | What is the max tier of consequences of failure? |

Sometimes it makes sense to roll to decide one of the effect, risk, or cost level.
If you do that, build an appropriate pool, take +/-1d per relevant factor, and roll to determine the level.
Usually it's better to determine more than one of them at once (especially effect + risk).
If you do _that_, negotiate a base level for effect and for risk (considering relevant factors), build the appropriate pool (but do NOT take bonus dice based on factors!), and roll to determine the actual level of effect and consequences.


### Special Approaches

Princesses have a few optional rules they can use when rolling dice (if the fiction permits).
* Teamwork. Everyone tries to do the same thing and picks one leader.
  She explains how she leads.
  Everybody makes the same roll (as they normally would).
  The leader picks one result that applies to everyone.
  The leader pays 1 favor for each failure this erases.
* Push yourself. During any roll, a princess may pay 2 favor, try very hard, and get +1d.
* Help a friend. During any friend's roll, a princess may pay 1 favor, say how they help, and give her +1d.
  If there are any consequences, she suffers them, too.  
  Non-princesses can help too in the fiction, which adjusts position and effect.
* Instigate. Whenever anyone rolls, suggest an unexpected way in which things get more interesting.
  If everyone agrees, she gets +1d, but the fictional wrinkle comes true.
* swap +1d/effect. Bonus dice from special approaches still count against a princess' 6d limit, but she can choose to set 1 aside unrolled for +effect.
* swap effect/risk. If there is a risk, you might agree to exchange risk for effect 1:1 before the roll by being especially aggressive or cautious.

#### When to roll for effect or cost?

During downtime especially, roll rank to determine effect (+/-1d per relevant factor). This can be used for projects, crafting, etc.

During constrained dramatic scenes roll attributes to determine effect or cost (+/-1d per relevant factor). This happens especially when the effect is known but the cost is not (like a dissent roll, breaking down a door, or searching a room; the primary question is one of time and noise!), or the cost is known but the effect is not (a friendly footrace that goes to the dice).

Relevant factors for effect include her fictional traits or secrets; consider:
* Quality. How do the magnitudes compare? Is this even possible? Appropriate tools or training?
* Potency. How appropriate is the approach? Does the situation encourage it?
* Scale. Or size, scope, number; bigger could be better or worse!

Relevant factors for risk & cost center around defense & safety; consider how badly this could go.
It's definitely more art than science.

During dynamic dramatic scenes (very common during an adventure, where princesses are directly opposed), roll for risk.

#### When to roll for risk?

Whenever a princess might suffer a consequence for her actions, implying a dramatic, dynamic scene where we discover what she's willing to risk.
If this isn't such a scene, consider whether this is really a roll for risk; perhaps it's a fixed cost or a random cost for her approach or goal?

The narrator states the level of effect and risk (using risk factors to adjust them).

Instead of rolling a normal attribute, the princess determines her pool through a questionnaire:

The princess picks up 0d, then adds one more for each link between her approach (or goal) and her player agenda:
* Is this kind (who does it help, and how)? +1d
* Is this bold (unexpected or awesome)? +1d
* Is this curious (what could we learn, what exploration does it reward)? +1d
* Is this true (to herself & the circumstances)? +1d

See "consequences" for advice on how to read the results.

> Answer these questions out loud!
> It's genre appropriate to externalize your emotions in this way, and it tells us your princess' truth.

> Can I just roll an attribute for risk instead of exploring my motivation?
> Maybe. Yes, I guess.
> It makes the action a lot less melodramatic, which means we don't get to learn what makes your princess tick.
> This seems particularly relevant around Danger rolls which would avoid resolving their kindness and curiousity.
> That's not heroic behavior!
> Consider acquiring some trauma to reflect your princess' disconnect and ennui?
