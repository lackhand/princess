Princesses are the main characters, so instead of having just one personal **tier** like most non-princesses, they have several different values which are used in a few different ways:

**Danger**
: How is she at athletics, derring-do, and violence?
  Avoids & recovers from consequences from physical strain or injury.

**Mystery**
: How is she at logic, stealth, crime, investigation, and intrigue?
  Avoids & recovers from consequences from deception or understanding.

**Charm**
: How is she at loving & living with friends, family, and foes?
  Avoids & recovers from consequences from destiny, society and emotion.

**Rank** (shared)
: How stable, supported, connected, and empowered are they?
  Deals with quality of equipment & downtime questions like healing, research, purchasing, etc.

> Between sessions it's reasonable to move a point between a princess' personal _attributes_ as our understanding of the character changes.
{:.aside}

You can decide to give a non-princess _attributes_ if it feels right, but usually adding _traits_ is better.

A princess always rolls the narrator-selected _attribute_ when she **defies**.

### Rank

All of the princesses share the same single value for their **rank**.

When the princess' **trouble** boils over, the world responds by stripping them of a point of **rank**, to reflect their changing circumstances and exposure.
Obviously their gear & their relationships don't magically self-destruct overnight! But maintenance falls behind, favors go unreturned, and tempers fray: the princesses are isolated.

Between sessions, the narrator should reconsider the fiction and adjust the rank upwards to reflect the princess' actions.
This makes sense as the outcome to targeted adventures like defeating an enemy lieutenant, securing a major ally or asset, or misdirecting the enemy's forces.
It might help to be explicit about this: tracking progress towards the next point of **rank** with a _clock_ that is ticked during adventures.
