Princesses are the main characters, so instead of having just one personal tier like most non-princesses, they have several different tiers which are used in a few different ways:

Danger
: How is she at athletics, derring-do, and violence?
  Avoids & recovers from consequences from physical strain or injury.

Mystery
: How is she at logic, stealth, crime, investigation, and intrigue?
  Avoids & recovers from consequences from deception or understanding.

Charm
: How is she at loving & living with friends, family, and foes?
  Avoids & recovers from consequences from destiny, society and emotion.

Rank (shared)
: How stable, supported, connected, and empowered are they?
  Deals with quality of equipment & downtime questions like healing, research, purchasing, etc.

> Between sessions it's reasonable to move a point between a princess' personal attributes as our understanding of the princess changes.

You can decide to give a non-princess attributes if it makes more sense than just one tier.
Usually it isn't worth it though.

A princess always rolls the narrator-selected attribute when she defies.

### Rank

All of the princesses share the same single value for their "rank".

When the princess' trouble boils over, the world responds by stripping them of a point of rank, to reflect the trouble boiling over and following them home.
Obviously their gear & their relationships don't magically self-destruct overnight! But maintenance falls behind, favors go unreturned, and tempers fray: the princesses are impoverished.

Between sessions, the narrator should reconsider the fiction and adjust the rank upwards to reflect the princess' actions.
This makes sense as the outcome to targeted adventures like defeating an enemy lieutenant, securing a major ally or asset, or misdirecting the enemy's forces.
It might help to be explicit about this, tracking progress towards the next point of rank with a clock ticked during adventures.
