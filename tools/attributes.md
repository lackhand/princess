Princesses are the main characters, so instead of having a personal tier like most non-princesses, they have several tiers which are used in a few different ways:

Danger
: How is she at athletics, derring-do, and weaponry?
  Avoids & recovers from consequences from physical strain or injury.

Mystery
: How is she at logic, espionage, crime, investigation, and intrigue?
  Avoids & recovers from consequences from deception or understanding.

Charm
: How is she at loving & living with friends, family, and foes?
  Avoids & recovers from consequences from destiny, society and emotion.

You can decide to give a non-princess attributes if it makes more sense than just its tier.
Usually it isn't worth it though.

A princess always rolls the narrator-selected attribute when she dissents.

All of the princesses share a single rank, which works a little bit like their tier: it's their power, resources, basic competence, and luck.
It's a good idea to start it at 0 for neophyte heroes, and to increase it when they've grown as characters and improved their standing in the world.

Rank
: How powerful, competent, supplied and lucky is she?
  Deals with downtime questions like healing, research, purchasing, etc.

> These numbers don't change through play, though between sessions it's reasonable to move a point between them.
> All of the princesses might get another point to spend between chapters, to reflect their growth.
> You might start with seven points to distribute between these three attributes.
