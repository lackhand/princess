If you're all "students" and "reincarnated heroes" or "giant robot pilots" or "witches", figure out what that looks like and give it to each of the princesses that to start from.

## Relationship Keys

If you want to tell a story about characters who are interrelated, it's a good idea to take traits that emphasize the relationships.
It's hard to share the spotlight if everyone's connected through a single princess (though a non-princess character can work).
It's also a cop-out to say that "we're all a big friend group" or something (even if it's true).  
It's boring, and unwieldy at the table.  
Add texture and variety and history instead:
even if every princess is a member of the Tea And Kendo Club, split them into couples and throuples.  
Some are the officers, and others merely members (great attribute, like President of or Treasurer of or Member of the Tea and Kendo Club).  
Some really care about the tea and others the kendo; still others are there for socializing or following a crush (subattributes?).  
But especially important is to answer: how do you feel about each other?
How do you feel about your friends in the same group (officers and rank-and-file, tea-fans and kendo-fans)? Different groups?
These form critical keys that link the princesses. Note that these are true but not necessarily reciprocal:
you can appreciate and process your childhood friendship differently than they do.

Childhood
: You have a tight bond from your childhood with another character.
  : Be influenced by them, or demonstrate your bond.
  : Sever the relationship.

Coworker/Roommate/Sibling
: You are trapped with this insane person with whom you would never otherwise choose to associate.
  : Be frustrated by (and amused by!) their antics. Criticise the princess (incorrect answers only).
  : Respect and admire them.

Doormat
: It's not healthy, but you hold your friends together by tempering the hotter personality of another.
  : Give in to them (when they're wrong).
  : Enforce your boundaries with them.

Rival
: You have an intensely competitive relationship with another.
  : When you one up them, or are a poor sport about being one-upped by them.
  : Admit defeat gracefully and give up.

Longing
: You have an embarrassingly intense crush on another.
  : Make a decision based on, or otherwise indicate, your crush.
  : Reveal or foreswear your love.

Friendmom
: You have an intensely caring relationship with another.
  : Be influenced by, or protect, them.
  : Let them sink or swim on their own.

Woobie
: You have an intensely needy relationship with another.
  : Beg for (& receive) help while you have no relevant attributes (or protection).
  : Vow you'll pull your own weight, and do so.

## Genre behavior keys

If you want to tell a story about characters that behave in a morally upright fashion, keys emphasize those themes.

Bold
: You are bold when caution would serve.
  : Choose action over safety in service of the genre.
  : Without breaking the genre, be selfish.

Curious
: You want the story to continue even when it could resolve too soon.
  : Let the enemy keep a secret, escape, or otherwise remain a mystery.
  : Finally resolve the mystery, declare your satisfaction, and move on.

Harbinger of Dawn
: You are on a mission to fulfil the Dawn Empress' final wish and to defeat the Burn.
  : Take action to complete the mission.
  : Abandon or redefine the mission.

Honorable
: You play fair, as an Alchemical Knight should.
  : Lead by example, as a paragon of skill and virtue.
  : Cheat to win, because the stakes are too high.

Kind
: You are kind when the world demands cruelty.
  : Choose mercy over violence in service of the genre.
  : Without breaking the genre, choose vengeance.

Starcrossed
: You have found love on the battlefield. With whom, or what?
  : Choose love over victory in service of the genre.
  : Without breaking the genre, foreswear your love and suffer great loss.

True
: You are steadfast when the world demands compomise.
  : Choose to be true to yourself and your passions rather than be rewarded for fitting in.
  : Without breaking the genre, change your essential nature for reward.

Key Kills Monsters
: ...But at the end of the day, it's a 4-color fantasy.
  : Face a monster greater than yourself in battle.
  : Acquire a trauma in battle with a monster.

> A word on using the shared expectation from the genre.
> It's a great idea to tie into your shared expectations mechanically,
> but it's important that you never use the break condition to reward breaking that trust!
> That would be terrible.
{:.warning}

## Secret Identity Keys

Since the hook implies secret identity, what with being hunted, so that traits related to that might be important!

Leaky Identity
: Exposing your nature is a measure of trust.
  : Expose your identity to someone to gain their trust.
  : Betray, harm, or abandon someone due to your dual life.

Secret Identity
: Exposing your nature is the height of foolishness.
  : Lie or mislead someone off of the trail of your identity.
  : Reveal both halves of your identity to someone who knew each separately, and going forward.

Open Identity
: Your natures are openly well-known.
  : Have trouble or duties from one identity interfere with the other.
  : Abandon one identity in favor of the other (usually: become a full-time hero)

Lost Identity
: You deny or suppress your nature.
  : Demonstrate your magical nature or excellence and ponder their reasoning.
  : Declare that you have lived a lie and are more than you seem.

Found Identity
: You want to know the details of your past life.
  : Get into trouble to learn more about yourself, the Alchemical Knights, or Alembic
  : Declare that who you are becoming is more important than who you were.

## Student Traits

A `TortA student` is a perfectly fine attribute.
But since everyone will have it, it's definitely worth recording in which ways your specific princess differs or excels:

> Track and field, Technologist, Teacher's Pet, Shop Class, Chess Club, Art Kid, Foreign Exchange, Premed, Jock, Nerd, Geology, Esoterica, Model UN

You might already have some of these (perhaps from your relationships). That's fine.

## Alchemical Knight Secrets

An Alchemical Knight of Alembic touches on magic, so it would benefit from some secrets:

Memories of Alembic
: You are a reincarnated soul of Alembic.
  Who were they? How were you alike? How do you differ? Which memories do you dream?
  : Even though you're a human, you qualify for magical traits (including secrets).
    You can take them later in play if you later in play remember having had them.
  : It's plausible to have memory scenes as your alter ego
    (for instance, to establish knowledge or relationships with other relics of Alembic).
  : Spend 2 favor to roll 4d on a risk roll (regardless of actual answers).

Sleeper of Alembic
: You're a nymph who survived from the fall of Alembic to the modern day by
  a sleeping curse, petrification, time travel, etc.
  You've only recently become awoken. How? By whom?
  : Humans assume you are human (without specific examination).
  : +1 favor.

Awakened of Alembic
: You're someone who originally perished in the fall of Alembic, but were magically reincarnated by the Burned as an animal or toy.
  What's your form? How did you escape? What did you learn?
  : +1d when you dissent a supernatural consequence.
  : +1d when you gather information about a relic of Alembic.

{:.magic} Magical Transformation
: With a glass surface and your reflection, you can channel that past life into the present,
  physically transforming yourself and your appearance until the next time that you sleep.
  : While you're transformed, gain potency in combat vs the supernatural. How? What does that look like?

{:.magic} Alchemical Science Mastery
: You have a grounding in one of the alchemical sciences, which you can use to understand and undertake magical projects.
  : When you learn this secret, pick one science to master:
    Alchemy : Alchemical potions, bombs, poisons, and metallurgy (one use, toxic)
    Thaumaturgy : Arcane devices, circuits, and crystals (expensive, slow)
    Chimerism : Chimerical plants, hybrids, and byproducts (one use, uncontrolled)
    Theonomy : Celestial summoning and ritual (one use, expensive, uncontrolled)
  : When you research, invent, or craft a creation using your science, treat your results as one result higher (failure->mixed, etc).
  : Gain one formula using your science now.

> Alchemical science mastery makes you more reliable in downtime projects involving your science.
> It's really alchemical engineering, and it's broader than 
{:.aside}


## Backfilling & new secrets

There's a lot of missing secrets here! For now, consider [stealing from blades in the dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/character-playbook).

In general, special abilities should come in a few forms:
* Special Armor, X (often: resist specific consequences / push self somehow).
  We don't have special armor (or any armor).
  Perhaps we should (tied into transformation?)?
  This is really just ~2 extra favor, a consequence-or-push.
* When you X, +1d (& skip one of the agenda questions)
* When you push yourself, +specific effects (you still get the normal benefits of pushing yourself)
* You can spend favor for an ability
* Limited +1d/+effect  (often +1d)
* +1 result level to downtime actions (often crafting or other projects)
* +potency (similar to +effect really)


### Inventing Formulae
Formulae can be invented as a long term project with a decent magical laboratory, tutor, and/or grounding.
Most new formulas or designs will require an 8-segment progress clock to invent and learn.

Creation Questions
Narrator asks: “What type of creation is it and what does it do?” Princess answers. A creation might be mundane, alchemical, arcane, or ritual.
If the princess has an appropriate secret, she get bonuses when inventing and crafting certain creation types.
Princess asks: “What’s the minimum quality level of this item?” Narrator answers, with the magnitude of the effects the item produces as a guideline.
Narrator asks: “What rare, strange, or adverse aspect of this formula or design has kept it in obscurity, out of common usage?” Princess answers.
Princess asks: “What drawbacks does this item have, if any?” Narrator answers by choosing one or more from the drawbacks list, or by saying there are none.

| Drawbacks | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Complex   | You’ll have to create it in multiple stages; the narrator will tell you how many. One downtime activity and crafting roll is needed per stage. |
| Conspicuous | This creation doesn’t go unnoticed. Take +1 trouble if it’s used any number of times on an operation. |
| Consumable | This creation has a limited number of uses (all alchemicals and rituals must have this drawback, usually one use). |
| Rare | This creation requires a rare item or material when it is crafted. |
| Unreliable | When you use the item, make a fortune roll (using its quality) to see how well it performs. |
| Volatile | The item produces a dangerous or troublesome side-effect as a consequence for the user (not target), specified by the narrator. |
