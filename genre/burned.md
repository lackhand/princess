### Secrets of the Burned

Sooner or later, things will get edgy.
Someone will seize Burned technology,
or be rescued from the Burned _after_ the last second but want her story to continue, 
or the princesses need to lower the Doom.

These represent specific fates to which princesses or other characters could be driven by the Burned.

Twisted
: You've had your essence changed by contact with The Burning. How did this change your body? Mind? Spirit?
  : When you act with manipulation or destruction, take +1d.

Hollow
: "You" cease to exist, leaving behind an animate empty vessel imprinted with your skills and memories.
  What of you did they lose? What did they retain? What can they become?
  : {:.prereq} You break your last key (possibly through the Rite of Extinguishment)
  : When you would roll drama, roll rank instead.
  : When you gain a harm, also gain 1 favor per rank. This is your only way to gain favor.
  : When you gain a trauma, also gain an advance.

Pyromancy
: You've nestled a burning coal in your heart for a measure of power.
  : {:.prereq} You consume some of The Burning.
  : You can gain trouble instead of spending favor 1:1, and the Burned know what happened when you do.

Burning Soul
: You have embraced The Burning to sustain your spirit despite the failing of your mortal frame.
  : {:.prereq} Pyromancy.
  : {:.prereq} You die in sorcerous circumstances.
  : You become a magical spirit like a jinn; your body is no longer yours; you're a cold-blooded selfish monster.
  : Your rank matches the level of doom.

Grand Mal
: Your body is a monstrous puppet to The Burning.
  : {:.prereq} Pyromancy.
  : {:.prereq} You take your fourth trauma in sorcerous circumstances.
  : You become an immense twisted monster like a chimera; you're driven by your worst impulses.
  : Your rank matches the level of doom.

Singed
: You've turned back from a dark path before it is too late for yourself.
  Your soul remains stained with what you've seen.
  : {:.prereq} Any other burned secret.
  : When you dissent a consequence from the Burned, take +1d.
  : When you investigate the Burned, take +1d.
