#### Chimeras

The stereotypical Burned are chimerical (or at the least, satyrical) mockeries of the orders of alembic, the natural world, and so on.
Most are fairly modern, having been created since Theophrastia's accidental summoning by the zodiacal society, created through dark chirurgical means from modern humans, powerful spirits from the fall of Alembic, and animals.

They're driven by urges; perhaps the obsession that led them to the Burned, or for wealth or power, or for hearts, hopes, or energy for the Burning.

or want to play on the edge.
