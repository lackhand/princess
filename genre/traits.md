If you're all "students" and "reincarnated heroes" or "giant robot pilots" or "witches", figure out what that looks like and give it to each of the princesses that panoply to start from.

# Relationship Keys

If you want to tell a story about characters who are interrelated, it's a good idea to take traits that emphasize the relationships.
It's hard to share the spotlight if everyone's connected through a single princess (though a non-princess character can work out).
It's also a cop-out to say that "we're all a big friend group" or something (even if it's true).  
It's boring, and unwieldy at the table.  
Add texture and variety and history instead:
even if every princess is a member of the Tea And Kendo Club, split them into couples and throuples.  
Some are the officers, and others merely members (great attribute, like President of or Treasurer of or Member of the Tea and Kendo Club).  
Some really care about the tea and others the kendo; still others are there for socializing or following a crush (subattributes?).  
But especially important is to answer: how do you feel about each other?
How do you feel about your friends in the same group (officers and rank-and-file, tea-fans and kendo-fans)? Different groups?
These form critical keys that link the princesses. Note that these are true but not necessarily reciprocal:
you can appreciate and process your childhood friendship differently than they do.

Devotion
: You have a tight bond and history with another character. Childhood friends, lovers, or partners!
  : Be influenced by them, or demonstrate your bond.
  : Sever the relationship.

Coworker/Roommate/Sibling
: You are trapped with this insane person with whom you would never otherwise choose to associate.
  : Be frustrated by (and amused by!) their antics. Criticise the princess (incorrect answers only).
  : Respect and admire them.

Doormat
: It's not healthy, but you hold your friends together by tempering the hotter personality of another.
  : Give in to them (when they're wrong).
  : Enforce your boundaries with them.

Rival
: You have an intensely competitive relationship with another.
  : When you one up them, or are a poor sport about being one-upped by them.
  : Admit defeat gracefully and give up.

Longing
: You have an embarrassingly intense crush on another, and you can't bring yourself to make it known.
  : Make a decision based on, or otherwise indicate, your crush.
  : Reveal or foreswear your love.

Friendmom
: You have an intensely caring relationship with another.
  : Be influenced by, or protect, them.
  : Let them sink or swim on their own.

Woobie
: You have an intensely needy relationship with another.
  : Beg for (& receive) help while you have no relevant attributes (or protection).
  : Vow you'll pull your own weight, and do so.

## (Optional) Randomizing Relationships

Give yourself a relationship with the player to your... (roll 2d for each row, skipping yourself):

|   | 1-3 | 4-5 | 6 | 6,6 |
|---|-----|-----|---|-----|
| With... | 1 seat right | 2 seats right | 3 seats right | 1 seat right, and roll again from their chair |
| They're... | Reversed  | Same result | Roll new result | None; somehow, they have no relationship with you at all |

To determine the nature of your relationship, roll 1d (the "Reversed" line is for their relationship with you, if any).

|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Result | Friendmom | Devotion | Longing | Rival | Roommate | Woobie |
| Reversed | Woobie | Longing | Rival | Roommate | Devotion | Friendmom |

If someone gets a relationship with you, you have the "they're" relationship with them (or whatever you want instead).

# Genre behavior keys

If you want to tell a story about characters that behave in a morally upright fashion, keys emphasize those themes.

Bold
: You are bold when caution would serve.
  : Choose action over safety in service of the genre.
  : Back down from a challenge.

Curious
: You want the story to continue even when it could resolve too soon.
  : Let the enemy keep a secret, escape, or otherwise remain a mystery.
  : Finally resolve the mystery, declare your satisfaction, and move on.

Harbinger of Dawn
: You are on a mission to fulfil the Dawn Empress' final wish and to defeat the Burn.
  : Take action to complete the mission.
  : Abandon or redefine the mission.

Honorable
: You play fair, as an Alchemical Knight should.
  : Lead by example, as a paragon of skill and virtue.
  : Cheat to win, because the stakes are too high.

Kind
: You are kind when the world demands cruelty.
  : Choose mercy over violence in service of the genre.
  : Without breaking the genre, choose vengeance.

Starcrossed
: You have found love on the battlefield. With whom, or what?
  : Choose love over victory in service of the genre.
  : Without breaking the genre, foreswear your love and suffer great loss.

True
: You are steadfast when the world demands compomise.
  : Choose to be true to yourself and your passions rather than be rewarded for fitting in.
  : Without breaking the genre, change your essential nature for reward.

Key Kills Monsters
: ...But at the end of the day, it's a 4-color fantasy.
  : Face a monster greater than yourself in battle.
  : Acquire a trauma in battle with a monster.
{:.key}



> A word on using the shared expectation from the genre.
> It's a great idea to tie into your shared expectations mechanically,
> but it's important that you never use the break condition to reward breaking that trust!
> That would be terrible.
{:.warning}

# Secret Identity Keys

Since the hook implies secret identity, what with being hunted, so that traits related to that might be important!

Leaky Identity
: Exposing your nature is a measure of trust.
  : Expose your identity to someone to gain their trust.
  : Betray, harm, or abandon someone due to your dual life.

Secret Identity
: Exposing your nature is the height of foolishness.
  : Lie or mislead someone off of the trail of your identity.
  : Reveal both halves of your identity to someone who knew each separately, and going forward.

Open Identity
: Your natures are openly well-known.
  : Have trouble or duties from one identity interfere with the other.
  : Abandon one identity in favor of the other (usually: become a full-time hero)

Lost Identity
: You deny or suppress your nature.
  : Demonstrate your magical nature or excellence and ponder their reasoning.
  : Declare that you have lived a lie and are more than you seem.

Found Identity
: You want to know the details of your past life.
  : Get into trouble to learn more about yourself, the Alchemical Knights, or Alembic
  : Declare that who you are becoming is more important than who you were.

# (Optional) Randomizing Genre Behavior & Identity Keys

These drives are best when they're highly varied and can create conflict.

So: Write them on slips of paper and pass them out randomly to each princess!
It should work fine to put them all into one big bucket and give one each, or you could ensure each princess gets one each of genre and identity.

# Student & other background Traits

A `Hartshorn student` is a perfectly fine trait, but we assume all of the princesses are; you only need a trait if you _aren't_ one. Similarly, `Human` `female` `age 18` and so on is assumed.

These _traits_ determine the ways in which your princess differs from the others.
Your _traits_ are also how you tell us about your princess' background, interests, skills and knacks.
You should pick these yourself, but if you need some inspiration, you could roll to see what that sparks:

|       | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **1** | Careful | Townie | Metalshop | Feral | Corporate | Flaky |
| **2** | Clever | Big City | Techie | Academied | Shrine | Nervous |
| **3** | Flashy | West Coast | Vet  | Big Family | Spa  | Vain |
| **4** | Forceful | Rural  | Jock  | Tough love | Store | Greedy |
| **5** | Quick  | Overseas | Poet | Stable home | Library | Gullible |
| **6** | Sneaky | Foreign | Model UN | Spoiled | Hospital | Blunt |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|       | Quality | Origin  | "Major" | Family  | Job     | "Flaws" |

You could choose or roll for some facet of your princess' past life (roll 1d for each column, or choose).
You were of course a princess; you also had reached a specific point in your duties as an alchemical knight!
You have a magical possession when you transform (give it a title!) which is tied to a power.

|       | Rank   | Role      | Posession |
|-------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **1** | Pawn   | Laborer   | Cloak     |
| **2** | Page   | Ranger    | Helm      |
| **3** | Squire | Cavalry   | Shield    |
| **4** | Rook   | Scholar   | Wand      |
| **5** | Bishop | Spy       | Device    |
| **6** | Knight | Merchant  | Weapon    |

# Alchemical Knight Secrets
