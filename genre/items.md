Anything the princesses purchase as a secret works the way the secrets dictate.
This section covers everything else, particularly when designing new gifts.

See gifts under tools for more advice about how to bring an item into the game.

Any item first needs to be _invented_ (which might take multiple downtime actions), and then either have its recipe _crafted_ or else be _borrowed_ from some source (both of which also consume downtime).
Sometimes an item is just encountered during an adventure, though -- perhaps it's seized at brought along?
That's fine!

### What is an item

A weapon, armor, special technique, ritual, companion, pet, or similar.
Any princess-exploitable stand-alone piece of rules text is an item.
We use the invention rules so that there's a way to balance the princess' giving themselves goodies with the sorts of challenges we want them to face.

### Design

This is sort of a metagame procedure: it defines what the item does as a conversation between a princess & the narrator.

Before beginning, work together to design the item:

* Narrator asks: "What type of item is this and what does it do?"
  * Princess answers.
    * An item might be mundane, alchemical, chimerical, thaumaturgic, or ritual;
    * A companion might be dangerous, intriguing, charming, or of rank
* Princess asks: "What’s the minimum quality tier of this item?"
  * Narrator answers, with the magnitude of the effects the item produces as a guideline
* Narrator asks: "What rare, strange, or adverse aspect of this formula or design has kept it in obscurity, out of common usage?"
  * Princess answers
* Princess asks: "What drawbacks does this item have, if any?"
  * Narrator answers with zero or more drawbacks

| Drawbacks | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Complex   | You’ll have to create it in multiple stages; the narrator will tell you how many. One downtime activity and crafting roll is needed per stage. |
| Conspicuous | This creation doesn’t go unnoticed. Take +1 trouble if it’s used any number of times per session. |
| Consumable | This creation has a limited number of uses (all alchemicals and rituals must have this drawback, usually one use). |
| Rare | This creation requires a rare item or material when it is crafted (or researched). |
| Unreliable | When you use the item, make a fortune roll (using its quality) to see how well it performs. |
| Volatile | The item produces a dangerous or troublesome side-effect as a consequence for the user (not target), specified by the narrator. |
| Hindrance | The item increases risk (& -1d defiance) for the user (not target) in any session where it's used. |

Volatile might looks like a Harm I _woozy_ or _contact high_, or a Harm II _sickened_ or _exhausted_.
Hindrances look like:
* Fragile (to crush)
* Reactive (to 3 non-crush damages):
  * Corroding (decay, freeze, zap). 
  * Conductive (burn, freeze, zap). Good for metal armors!
  * Synthetic (burn, decay, zap). 
  * Wilting (burn, decay, freeze). Good for leather or wooden armors!
* Noisy (to detection)
* Distracting (to perception)
* Cursed/Ugly (to magical or spiritual consequences)

If the princess has an appropriate secret, she get bonuses when inventing (and crafting, borrowing, or befriending) certain creation types!

### Invention

Once the item is designed, the princess needs to actually research it in game.
This usually requires an 8-clock downtime project with access to appropriate facilities (like a magical laboratory, tutor, or research material).
It might be more time or require some conditions based on the item's design; decyphering someone else's design might only be a 4-clock, while a gamebreaking item might require several adventures to acquire components to even invent the item.

Anyway, once it's complete, the princess learns the formula!

### Crafting or Borrowing

See the appropriate downtime actions.

Common items (below) can be crafted or borrowed without first being invented; everyone knows their recipes.

Items are listed with a quality tier (for purchase or borrow).

### Mundane items

Crowbars, bicycles, motorbikes, potato canons, cameras, pies, scarves, bookends, paintings: mundane items.
Anything you could make in shop class or by watching videos online is common.
Anything else (machines, medicines, etc) might need to be researched or require a more advanced workshop and research first.

If you need guidance for purchase difficulties, roughly the more detailed something's name is, the higher tier:
* Single syllable abstract objects -- sword (I), gun (I), car (I), gem (I) -- get you toy versions at best.
  * Of course, you could get an automobile (IV; if "brand new", VI!) or motorbike (III)...
  * Can you get a bike (I) or must you get a bicycle (III)? Bike's probably fine.
* A rapier (II) or longsword (II) are lower tier than a katana (III), bowie knife (III) or bec-de-corbin (IV)
* A piano (III) is about as complex as a saxophone (III) or triangle (III) (consider a chime(I) instead?)

### Alchemical items

These work by extracting the salts, sulfurs, and mercury essences of mundane and magical substances; commonly called Potions.
They're only usable by someone whose spirits are attuned to their subtle principles (all alchemical knights are; a knight could provide or feed them to another person though!).
Anyone can theoretically manufacture one though, since they work on firm alchemical principles.

Drinking a potion makes the knight Harm I _woozy_ (or as indicated).

* Bliss (I): A pleasurable drug
* Strength (II): +effect on Danger (then: _weak_)
* Wisdom (IV): +effect on Intrigue (then: _tired_)
* Love (III): +effect on Charm (then: _loopy_)
* Speed (IV): +effect on Danger more differenter (then: _slow_)
* Catseye (II): See in the dark for a night (& _dazzled_)
* Oil of Gaseous Form (III): Become a cloud for a chore
* Flight (IV): Fly for a chore
* Enlarge (I): Get bigger (+1 scale)
* Reduce (II): Get (or make another) smaller (-2 scale)
* Resistance (I, II, III): ignore burn, decay, freeze, zap at this level or below
* Invulnerability (III): ignore hit below this level
* Mind Reading (III)
* Visions (III): Clairvoyance
* Heroism: +quality and +scale
* Water breathing (III): Breathe underwater for a night
* Bezoar (II): +effect against ingested and injected poisons & disease for a day
* Elixir of Health (III): Immunity & repair ingested, injected, or inhaled poisons & disease
* Dust of Disappearance (II): Remain unseen & unheard for a breath or until you move
* Dust of Dryness (II)
* Dust of Sneezing and Choking (II)
* Oil of Slipperiness (II)
* Oil of Webbing (II)
* Oil of Invisibility (IV): Remain unseen & unheard for the length of a chore
* Heart's Form (IV): Transforms other people into equivalent beasts: deer, pigs, large dogs, goats, llamas, etc. Princesses can pick any one animal, 100-250 lbs or so!
* Stability (III): Halts the effect of all alchemicals
* Delay Pain (I): Reduce all harm's levels by 1 for 1 scene (apply _volatile_ at end).
* Healing (II, III, IV): Reduces 1, 2 or 3 levels of harm (except alchemical; remember _volatile_'s harm!)
* Flaming Oil (0): Easy burns. Gasoline.
* Acid (0-III): Various potencies of decay damage
* Poisons (0-VI): Various targets, potencies, deliveries.
* Arrow of Slaying (IV)
* Spark (II): Pleasurable drug, leaves you trailing painful shocks
* Firebreathing (II): Spit burning gouts for three breaths.
* Smokebomb (I): Hides!
* Firebomb (III): Explodes, spreading burning flame!
* Bomb (II, V): Explodes! Smaller, and then sufficient to bring down a building.
* Stinking Cloud (III): Blinds & stinks!
* Confusion (IV): Confounding fog!

### Chimeristry items

There are two branches of chimeristry: breeding and controlling new creatures (Chimeric), and enhancing or altering oneself or others (Chirurgic).
Breeding and controlling creatures works similar to befriending companions.
Enhancing or altering oneself works similarly to thaumaturgy.
Both work through using alchemical processes on living creatures, with physical or chemical alteration required.
Chimeristry is almost always monstrous, indecorous, or just weird: inhuman features, grafts, or just tattoos and piercings.

In magical circles, some chimerical companions include:
* Beasties (I-III): A general term for mid-sized animal hybrids: bunyip (I) - basilisk (III); often with minor magical talents.
  * Familiar (0): Bat, cat, raven, toad, serpent, etc; each has their own personality and can speak.
    Generally lazy, cowardly, and dim.
    * Sometimes Awakened pose as familiars; they're significantly brighter!
  * Homunculus (I): A twenty pound bottle goblin, with features, memories & personality derived from her mother (though very poorly). Some can shift forms even post decanting.
  * Swamp Dragon (I): A teakettle-sized flabby lizard that can belch wispy fire.
  * Brain Leech (II): A glistening slug that goes in the ear and eats your ego.
  * Witchtaster serpent (II): A pet snake with horns that tastes, and slowly eats, psychic energies and emotional outbursts.
  * Hawkwolf (III): A smashup of predators of the land and sky (though too heavy to fly). Or sea & sky; moleshark?
* Satyr (II-IV): An id-driven part-animal part-human; goat+man, but also harpies, gnolls, centaurs, cervidals, minotaurs, etc. Rarely particularly magical, but can be!
* True Chimera (IV+): A legendary amalgam creature: hydra, dragon, sphinx, unicorn, shedu, etc. Often with fairly unusual metaphysical or elemental powers (living stone, bleeds fire, freezing glare, spring aura, psychic, etc).

Creating a "true chimera" using chimeristry doesn't guarantee the metaphysical powers of the creature; breeding for the form of a unicorn probably results in something bloodthirsty that spits acid, has burning blood, and hunts anything that moves.
Breeding for temperament is possible, but generally results in calmer or less useful pets (see: familiars).

The exception are the Burned, whose version of chimeristry works more immediately: exposure to the Burning leaves monstrous chimeras in its wake.

### Thaumaturgic items

Alembic was a magical society with unusual materials and all sorts of wonders: farcast voices, many league boots, flying carpets, golem labor, and wands which could summon or channel forces. These objects are now called relics.

Humans are only weakly magical themselves; relics use everpresent magical energy and materials to accomplish their effects.
Relics are made out of mythical or poetic materials like silversteel mithril, dragonbone, adamant, orichalcum, fish's breath, mountain roots, spirit's tear, or silk-of-shadows.
Whoever manufactures (or operates) a relic must be sensitive to subtle energies.
More powerful relics might require cool down or a source of power to recharge.
Thaumaturgical items produced before the fall of Alembic are often much more powerful than the ones an alchemical knight could cobble together in the modern day, since they had a full society behind their manufacture.
However, a princess might be able to combine multiple devices, improve on one, or combine modern and ancient technologies...

### Celestial Ritual

Celestials are abstract beings that wait to be called.

They are patterns; twists in the weave of physics, in the world's nightmares, in history's tale.
Any corporeal form it might have is an avatar or incidental effect of its presence on the world.
And they do have an effect: things under the influence of the celestial bear its mark.
This might take the form of psychic gifts.
This might take the form of behavioral, mental or physical changes.
This might take the form of altered physics, metaphysics, ontology.
Their gifts await only the proper contact, the proper invitation.

Rituals make contact with, channel, and manipulate these entities. If this sounds dangerous, that's because it is!

Mechanically, they're no different than other items: they're invented, and then they're crafted during downtime: the scroll is inscribed, the materials gathered, and the ritual circle prepared.
Actually performing the ritual then follows, and could be anything; a five hour poetry recital, or merely thinking about a glyph.

Remember, you don't need a ritual to do something magical!
A chimerical gift, an alchemical potion, or especially a thaumaturgic relic all create magical effects.

* Narrator asks: "What is this ritual, and why is it weird?"
  * Princess answers.
* Princess asks: "What’s must I do to perform the ritual, and what is its **cost**?"
  * Narrator answers, with the magnitude of the effects as a guideline
  * This always includes **favor** equal to its tier, and potentially additional **costs**, **risks** or **consequences**
* Narrator asks: "What new belief or fear does knowledge of this ritual and its attendant occult forces instill in you?"
  * Princess answers
* Princess asks: "What drawbacks does this item have, if any?"
  * Narrator answers with zero or more drawbacks

You can periodically review these questions and change your answers if the ritual keeps coming up.
