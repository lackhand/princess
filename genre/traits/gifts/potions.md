title: Alchemical Potions
section: "2.3.6.1"
---

These work by extracting the salts, sulfurs, and mercury essences of mundane and magical substances; commonly called Potions (though that also refers to a specifically quaffed potion).
They're all single-use (per session).

* Bombs are flung or destroyed, releasing their contents. They're usually _troublesome_ (+1 **trouble** if you use any).
* Drugs are eaten (including accidentally), usually _for_ their volatile effect.
* Dusts are blown or inhaled. They are _volatile_ (Harm I _buzzed_).
* Venoms are injected or smeared (including by darts). They are _volatile_ (Harm I _buzzed_).
* Oils are splashed, smeared, or flung. They're not _volatile_.
* Generic potions are as drugs (but with more magical effects).

Remember, _volatile_ affects the princess who handles or uses the potion, not necessarily the target!
Most potions are load 1, but a princess that specializes in potions might take a _secret_ to make them 3:1 load.
