title: Alchemical Potions
section: "2.3.5.4"
---

These work by extracting the salts, sulfurs, and mercury essences of mundane and magical substances; commonly called Potions.
They're only usable by someone whose spirits are attuned to their subtle principles (all alchemical knights are; a knight could provide or feed them to another person though!).

Using a potion, dust, poison, philtre or oil makes the knight Harm I _woozy_ (or as indicated).

A "philtre" is a cross between a potion and a poison. If the alchemical knight drinks her own philtre, she doesn't take the additional Harm I _woozy_, just the listed trait(s).
