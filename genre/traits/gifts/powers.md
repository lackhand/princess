Alchemical Knights (and other characters) have powers.
Alchemical knights in particular have power _suites_; the Princess of Petals can control flowers great, but perhaps not wind. 

Like other unusual gifts, powers flow from the princess' _traits_.
In the same way that a climbing kit gives you permission to scale a cliff (and perhaps you could even try it without), or a survival kit to spend the night in an inhospitable environment, a power or other psychic gift let you do the same thing.

They're pretty severely limited; while a princess doesn't have to pay for a power she doesn't use in a session, she usually doesn't get to invent novel powers out of nowhere.

They're limited to the princess' **rank** like other gifts.
