title: Designing Gifts
section: "2.3.5.1"

This is sort of a metagame procedure: it defines what the gift does as a conversation between the princess' player & the narrator.

Before beginning, work together to design the gift:

* Narrator asks: "What type of gift is this and what does it do?"
  * Princess answers.
    * A gift might be mundane, alchemical, chimerical, thaumaturgic, or ritual;
    * A companion might be dangerous, intriguing, charming, or of rank
* Princess asks: "Whatâ€™s the minimum quality tier of this gift?"
  * Narrator answers, with the magnitude of the effects the gift produces as a guideline
* Narrator asks: "What rare, strange, or adverse aspect of this formula or design has kept it in obscurity, out of common usage?"
  * Princess answers
* Princess asks: "What _drawbacks_ does this gift have, if any?"
  * Narrator answers with zero or more drawbacks

If the princess has an appropriate secret, she get bonuses when inventing (and crafting, borrowing, or befriending) certain creation types!

# Invention during downtime

Once the gift is designed, the princess needs to actually research how to construct it (or to make contact) in-game.

This usually requires an 8-clock downtime project with access to appropriate facilities (like a magical laboratory, tutor, or research material; social clubs, mixers, and headhunters).
It might be more time or require some conditions based on the item's design; decyphering someone else's design might only be a 4-clock, while a gamebreaking item might require several adventures to acquire components to even invent the item.

Anyway, once it's complete, the princess learns the formula!

In theory, after it's learned, the princess can craft it "forever".
In practice, suppliers change, the rules of magic shift, reagent prices move, laws change, hidden flaws are revealed -- revisit designs as needed through a game to keep things fun for everyone.

For companions, this "formula" is their contact information and an established link.

# Other procedures

The listed questions & process works for physical inventions, mundane or magical.
But you should actually follow the procedure that makes sense from the fiction; they're just guidelines.

For instance, uncovering or inventing a new celestial ritual could substitute a different questionnaire:

* Narrator asks: "What is this ritual, and why is it weird?"
  * Princess answers.
* Princess asks: "What must I do to perform the ritual, and what is its **cost**?"
  * Narrator answers, with the magnitude of the effects as a guideline
  * This always includes **favor** equal to its tier, and potentially additional **consequences** or **risks**
* Narrator asks: "What new belief or fear does knowledge of this ritual and its attendant occult forces instill in you?"
  * Princess answers

Or for introducing companion characters or services:

* Narrator asks: "Who is this companion, and what makes them special?"
  * Princess answers
* Princess asks: "What are the **costs** (and **risks** and **consequences**) of asking for their aid?"
  * Narrator answers
* Narrator asks: "What new belief or fear does knowledge of this person and their attendant social forces instill in you?"
  * Princess answers
