title: Thaumaturgic Relics
section: "2.3.5.6"
---

Alembic was a magical society with unusual materials and all sorts of wonders: farcast voices, many league boots, flying carpets, golem labor, and wands which could summon or channel forces. These objects are now called relics.

Humans are only weakly magical themselves; relics use everpresent magical energy and materials to accomplish their effects.
Relics are made out of mythical or poetic materials like silversteel mithril, dragonbone, adamant, orichalcum, fish's breath, mountain roots, spirit's tear, or silk-of-shadows.
Whoever manufactures (or operates) a relic must themselves be sensitive to subtle energies.
Thaumaturgical items produced before the fall of Alembic are often much more powerful than the ones an alchemical knight could cobble together in the modern day, since they had a full society behind their manufacture.
However, a princess might be able to combine multiple relics, improve on one with science, or otherwise adapt one that they find.
