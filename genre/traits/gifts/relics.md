title: Thaumaturgic Relics
section: "2.3.6.2"
---

Alembic was a magical society with unusual materials and all sorts of wonders: farcast voices, many league boots, flying carpets, golem labor, and wands which could summon or channel forces. These objects are now called relics.

Humans are only weakly magical themselves; relics use everpresent magical energy and materials to accomplish their effects.
Relics are made out of mythical or poetic materials like silversteel mithril, dragonbone, adamant, orichalcum, fish's breath, mountain roots, spirit's tear, or silk-of-shadows.
Whoever manufactures (or operates) a relic must themselves be sensitive to subtle energies.
Thaumaturgical items produced before the fall of Alembic are often much more powerful than the ones an alchemical knight could cobble together in the modern day, since they had a full society behind their manufacture.
However, a princess might be able to combine multiple relics, improve on one with science, or otherwise adapt one that they find.

Some materials that might figure into these. Forgotten in the modern day, these are good words to throw onto relics (along with others: iron, silk, etc). Any or all might gleam or glow.

Adamant
: Hard light, glassteel; transparent crystals or constructs; associated with captured or channeled energy; durable like steel but shatters if overcome like glass. Magnetizable. Not particularly rarer than other gemstones.

Dragonic
: Bone, tooth, horn, scale, hide; parts of mighty chimera as hard as iron. Old magic, primal and elemental.

Mithril
: Silversteel, truesilver; has some of the properties of aluminum or titanium; associated with light, the moon, mood, spirits; takes enchantment well.

Orichalcum
: Mountain copper, wild ore; has properties similar to bronze or brass; associated with heat, energy, the sun; elemental and wild.
