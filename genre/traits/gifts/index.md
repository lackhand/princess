See `tools>gifts` for more advice about how to bring a gift into the game.

A new gift first needs to be _invented_ (which might take multiple _downtime actions_), and then either have its recipe _crafted_ or else be _borrowed_ from some source (both of which also consume downtime).
Alternatively, in the fiction a princess might juryrig, commandeer, purchase, coopt or convince herself into a new piece of equipment, ally, or power.
That's fine too!

# What is a gift?

A weapon, armor, special technique, ritual, companion, pet, superpower, or similar.
Any princess-exploitable stand-alone piece of rules text.
We use the _invention_ rules so that there's a way to balance the princess' giving themselves goodies with the sorts of challenges we want them to face.

The princess' own gifts are limited to her **rank**, though those that are unlocked in fiction might have their own.
If they're rank 0 and want a bomb, they will have a *very* weak noisemaker at best; if they're rank III, they could easily get grenades, and rank V could get C4 or equivalent.
Particularly as a princess wants to affect a large scale with a gift, she'll tend to have very little force at that scale.
