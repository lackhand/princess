There are two branches of chimeristry: breeding and controlling new creatures (Chimeric), and enhancing or altering oneself or others (Chirurgic).
Breeding and controlling creatures works similar to befriending companions.
Enhancing or altering oneself works similarly to thaumaturgy.
Both work through using alchemical processes on living creatures, with physical or chemical alteration required.
Chimeristry is almost always monstrous, indecorous, or just weird: inhuman features, grafts, or just tattoos and piercings.

In magical circles, some chimerical companions include:
* Beasties (I-III): A general term for mid-sized animal hybrids: bunyip (I) - basilisk (III); often with minor magical talents.
  * Familiar (0): Bat, cat, raven, toad, serpent, etc; each has their own personality and can speak.
    Generally lazy, cowardly, and dim.
    * Sometimes Awakened pose as familiars; they're significantly brighter!
  * Homunculus (I): A twenty pound bottle goblin, with features, memories & personality derived from her mother (though very poorly). Some can shift forms even post decanting.
  * Swamp Dragon (I): A teakettle-sized flabby lizard that can belch wispy fire.
  * Brain Leech (II): A glistening slug that goes in the ear and eats your ego.
  * Witchtaster serpent (II): A pet snake with horns that tastes, and slowly eats, psychic energies and emotional outbursts.
  * Hawkwolf (III): A smashup of predators of the land and sky (though too heavy to fly). Or sea & sky; moleshark?
* Satyr (II-IV): An id-driven part-animal part-human; goat+man, but also harpies, gnolls, centaurs, cervidals, minotaurs, etc. Rarely particularly magical, but can be!
* True Chimera (IV+): A legendary amalgam creature: hydra, dragon, sphinx, unicorn, shedu, etc. Often with fairly unusual metaphysical or elemental powers (living stone, bleeds fire, freezing glare, spring aura, psychic, etc).

Creating a "true chimera" using chimeristry doesn't guarantee the metaphysical powers of the creature; breeding for the form of a unicorn probably results in something bloodthirsty that spits acid, has burning blood, and hunts anything that moves.
Breeding for temperament is possible, but generally results in calmer or less useful pets (see: familiars).

The exception are the Burned, whose version of chimeristry works more immediately: exposure to the Burning leaves monstrous chimeras in its wake.
