Celestials are abstract beings that wait to be called by the appropriate rites.

They are patterns; twists in the weave of physics, in the world's nightmares, in history's tale.
Any corporeal form it might have is an avatar or incidental effect of its presence on the world.
And they do have an effect: things under the influence of the celestial bear its mark.
This might take the form of psychic gifts.
This might take the form of behavioral, mental or physical changes.
This might take the form of altered physics, metaphysics, ontology.
Their gifts await only the proper contact, the proper invitation.

Rituals make contact with, channel, and manipulate these entities. If this sounds dangerous, that's because it is!

Mechanically, they're no different than other items: they're invented, and then they're crafted during downtime: the scroll is inscribed, the materials gathered, and the ritual circle prepared.
Actually performing the ritual then follows, and could be anything; a five hour poetry recital, or merely thinking about a glyph.

Generic rituals whose effects are fairly understood include:

| Name |   |

Of special note, there's a class of rituals, **Call Name**, which work more like _companions_ than like other rituals (contacting a specific entity for favors or service).
It might serve as a _commune_ (a number of yes/no questions equal to its **tier**, answered with one word each).
It might offer aid like allies, agents, communication, tools, secrets, etc.
It might attempt to incarnate itself an avatar, requiring additional circumstances to fully realize itself.
