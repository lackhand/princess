All alchemical knights deserve a secret or two to explain their relationship to magic.

Memories of Alembic
: You are a reincarnated Alchemical Knight of Alembic.
  Who were they? How were you alike? How do you differ? Which memories do you dream?
  : +1 favor.

Sleeper of Alembic
: You're a magical being who survived from the fall of Alembic to the modern day through a sleeping curse, petrification, time travel, etc.
  You've only recently become awoken. How? By whom? How do you feel about the modern world?
  : +1d when you defy a supernatural consequence.
  : +1d when you gather information about a relic of Alembic.

Incarnated of Alembic
: You're someone who originally perished in the fall of Alembic, but were magically reincarnated as an animal or toy.
  What's your form? Who bound you in your form? How did you escape? What did you learn?
  : Penalties from harm are 1 level less severe for you

Alchemical Affinity
: You have a knack for one of the alchemical sciences, which you can use to understand and undertake magical projects.
  : When you learn this secret, pick one science to master.
  : When you research, invent, or craft a creation using your science, treat your results as one result higher (failure->mixed, etc).
  : Gain one science formula now.
  : > You can research and craft formulae without affinity, but it's a longer and more expensive road.
