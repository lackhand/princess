It can be a lot of fun to randomize characters (see the pregens, or make your own characters, if you prefer not to randomize them).

# Randomizing Relationships

Give yourself a relationship with the player to your... (roll 2d for each row, skipping yourself):

|   | 1-3 | 4-5 | 6 | 6,6 |
|---|-----|-----|---|-----|
| With... | 1 seat right | 2 seats right | 3 seats right | 1 seat right, and roll again from their chair |
| They're... | Reversed  | Same result | Roll new result | None; somehow, they have no relationship with you at all |

To determine the nature of your relationship, roll 1d (the "Reversed" line is for their relationship with you, if any).

|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Result | Friendmom | Devotion | Longing | Rival | Roommate | Woobie |
| Reversed | Woobie | Longing | Rival | Roommate | Devotion | Friendmom |

If someone gets a relationship with you, you have the "they're" relationship with them (or whatever you want instead).

# Randomizing other keys

These drives are best when they're highly varied and can create conflict.

So: Write them on slips of paper and pass them out randomly to each princess!
It should work fine to put them all into one big bucket and give one each, or you could ensure each princess gets one each of genre and identity.
