It can be a lot of fun to randomize characters (see the pregens, or make your own characters, if you prefer not to randomize them).

# Randomizing Relationships

Give yourself a relationship with the player to your... (roll 2d for each row, skipping yourself):

|   | 1-3 | 4-5 | 6 | 6,6 |
|---|-----|-----|---|-----|
| With... | 1 seat right | 2 seats right | 3 seats right | 1 seat right, and roll again from their chair |
| They're... | Reversed  | Same result | Roll new result | None; somehow, they have no relationship with you at all |

To determine the nature of your relationship, roll 1d (the "Reversed" line is for their relationship with you, if any).

|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Result | Friendmom | Devotion | Longing | Rival | Roommate | Woobie |
| Reversed | Woobie | Longing | Rival | Roommate | Devotion | Friendmom |

If someone gets a relationship with you, you have the "they're" relationship with them (or whatever you want instead).

# Randomizing other keys

These drives are best when they're highly varied and can create conflict.

So: Write them on slips of paper and pass them out randomly to each princess!
It should work fine to put them all into one big bucket and give one each, or you could ensure each princess gets one each of genre and identity.

# Student & other background Traits

A `Hartshorn student` is a perfectly fine trait, but we assume all of the princesses are; you only need a trait if you _aren't_ one. Similarly, `Human` `female` `age 18` and so on is assumed (or whatever your equivalent is).

These _traits_ determine the ways in which your princess differs from the others.
Your _traits_ are also how you tell us about your princess' background, interests, skills and knacks.
You should pick these yourself, but if you need some inspiration, you could roll to see what that sparks:

|   | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   |
|   | Quality | Origin  | "Major" | Family  | Job     | "Flaws" |
|---|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Careful | Townie | Metalshop | Feral | Corporate | Flaky |
| 2 | Clever | Big City | Techie | Academied | Shrine | Nervous |
| 3 | Flashy | West Coast | Vet  | Big Family | Spa  | Vain |
| 4 | Forceful | Rural  | Jock  | Tough love | Store | Greedy |
| 5 | Quick  | Overseas | Poet | Stable home | Library | Gullible |
| 6 | Sneaky | Foreign | Model UN | Spoiled | Hospital | Blunt |
