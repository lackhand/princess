Good keys underscore the drives and themes of the campaign.
You can always work the player agenda in.
You could also tie into activities you expect to encounter, behaviors in-game you want to reward, campaign elements you want to introduce, or areas of concern you want the princesses to have.

  : Choose action over safety in service of the genre.

> A word on using the shared expectation from the genre.
> It's a great idea to tie into your shared expectations mechanically,
> but it's important that you never use the break condition to reward breaking that trust!
> That would be terrible.

  : Expose your identity to someone to gain their trust.
  : Betray, harm, or abandon someone due to your dual life.

Secret Identity

  : Lie or mislead someone off of the trail of your identity.
  : Reveal both halves of your identity to someone who knew each separately, and going forward.

Open Identity
: Your natures are openly well-known.
  : Have trouble or duties from one identity interfere with the other.
  : Abandon one identity in favor of the other (usually: become a full-time hero)

Lost Identity
: You deny or suppress your nature.
  : Demonstrate your magical nature or excellence and ponder their reasoning.
  : Declare that you have lived a lie and are more than you seem.

Found Identity
: You want to know the details of your past life.
  : Get into trouble to learn more about yourself, the Alchemical Knights, or Alembic
