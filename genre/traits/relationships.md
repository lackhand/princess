If you want to tell a story about characters who are interrelated, it's a good idea to take traits that emphasize the relationships.
It's hard to share the spotlight if everyone's connected through a single princess (though a non-princess character can work out).
It's also a cop-out to say that "we're all a big friend group" or something (even if it's true).  
It's boring, and unwieldy at the table.  
Add texture and variety and history instead:
even if every princess is a member of the Tea And Kendo Club, split them into couples and throuples.  
Some are the officers, and others merely members (great attribute, like President of or Treasurer of or Member of the Tea and Kendo Club).  
Some really care about the tea and others the kendo; still others are there for socializing or following a crush (subattributes?).  
But especially important is to answer: how do you feel about each other?
How do you feel about your friends in the same group (officers and rank-and-file, tea-fans and kendo-fans)? Different groups?
These form critical keys that link the princesses. Note that these are true but not necessarily reciprocal:
you can appreciate and process your childhood friendship differently than they do.

Devotion
: You have a tight bond and history with another character. Childhood friends, lovers, or partners!
  : Be influenced by them, or demonstrate your bond.
  : Sever the relationship.

Coworker/Roommate/Sibling
: You are trapped with this insane person with whom you would never otherwise choose to associate.
  : Be frustrated by (and amused by!) their antics. Criticise the princess (incorrect answers only).
  : Respect and admire them.

Doormat
: It's not healthy, but you hold your friends together by tempering the hotter personality of another.
  : Give in to them (when they're wrong).
  : Enforce your boundaries with them.

Rival
: You have an intensely competitive relationship with another.
  : When you one up them, or are a poor sport about being one-upped by them.
  : Admit defeat gracefully and give up.

Longing
: You have an embarrassingly intense crush on another, and you can't bring yourself to make it known.
  : Make a decision based on, or otherwise indicate, your crush.
  : Reveal or foreswear your love.

Friendmom
: You have an intensely caring relationship with another.
  : Be influenced by, or protect, them.
  : Let them sink or swim on their own.

Woobie
: You have an intensely needy relationship with another.
  : Beg for (& receive) help while you have no relevant attributes (or protection).
  : Vow you'll pull your own weight, and do so.
