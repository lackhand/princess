If you're all "students" and "reincarnated heroes" or "giant robot pilots" or "witches", figure out what that looks like for everyone (often it's just a fictional trait, or maybe a collection of traits and secrets).

# Student & other background Traits

A `Hartshorn student` is a perfectly fine trait, but we assume all of the princesses are; you only need a trait if you _aren't_ one. Similarly, `Human` `female` `age 18` and so on is assumed (or whatever your equivalent is).

These _traits_ determine the ways in which your princess differs from the others.
Your _traits_ are also how you tell us about your princess' background, interests, skills and knacks.
You should pick these yourself, but if you need some inspiration, you could roll to see what that sparks:

|       | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **1** | Careful | Townie | Metalshop | Feral | Corporate | Flaky |
| **2** | Clever | Big City | Techie | Academied | Shrine | Nervous |
| **3** | Flashy | West Coast | Vet  | Big Family | Spa  | Vain |
| **4** | Forceful | Rural  | Jock  | Tough love | Store | Greedy |
| **5** | Quick  | Overseas | Poet | Stable home | Library | Gullible |
| **6** | Sneaky | Foreign | Model UN | Spoiled | Hospital | Blunt |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|       | Quality | Origin  | "Major" | Family  | Job     | "Flaws" |

# Alchemical Knight Secrets
