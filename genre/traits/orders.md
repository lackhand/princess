title: The Elemental Orders of Alembic
section: "2.3.3"
---

Alchemical Knights believed -- and named their military orders after -- the Alchemical Metals (choose, or roll 1d).

| Roll   | Order   | Nickname | Element(s) |
|--------|---------|----------|------------|
| 1      | Mercury | Undine, "Selkies" | Water, ice, technology, speed; rivers |
| 2      | Copper  | Dryads   | Growth and decay; forests and swamps |
| 3      | Silver  | Djinn, "Sylphs" | Intuition, community, protection, change; coasts |
| 4      | Gold    | Marid    | Strength, skill, stability, law, truth; fields |
| 5      | Iron    | Efreet, "Salamanders" | Fire, metal, industry, creativity; hills  |
| 6      | Tin     | Oread, "Anemoi" | Electricity, prosperity, power, faith; mountains |
| 7(???) | Lead    | Furies   | Endings, visions, the dead, punishment, recovery; underground |
| -1     | Orichalcum | Kaustos  | Deserts. Mirages. Miracles. Loss. |

and (of course!) as military orders, they had ranks and materials which your princess might remember (choose, or roll 1d for each column):

|   | Rank   | Role      | Posession |
|---|--------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Pawn   | Laborer   | Cloak     |
| 2 | Page   | Ranger    | Helm      |
| 3 | Squire | Cavalry   | Shield    |
| 4 | Rook   | Scholar   | Wand      |
| 5 | Bishop | Spy       | Device    |
| 6 | Knight | Merchant  | Weapon    |

Use your order to help you decide on your princess' theme and abilities.
It isn't a straightjacket; while in Alembic these Orders were some combination of ethnicity, faith, and employment, your alchemical knight was a unique character of special import and destiny.

The princess' _gifts_ follow from her traits; more specifically, from her order (and even more specifically, from her titles and attributes within that order).
For instance, a Marid might be able to summon a sword of light, but is unlikely to have hydrokinesis; an undine might have power over mist and rain but not rivers (or not _yet_ rivers).
