title: Parcel the Cat
section: "2.0.1"
---

Parcel was a loyal advisor to the Dawn Empress in the Crystal Palace of Alembic, until Dark Queen Theophrasta summoned the Burning.
He died.
Dr Sulefilm bound him into a white-socked kitten in the basement of the Temple of Zodiacal Light; interrogated him, taught him english, and held him prisoner for a dozen years.
Until the Moon Maiden attacked the temple.
During the fight, a giant flaming manticore destroyed the temple (and her), and Parcel escaped during the confusion.
He found Dawn after a few years, and they've been looking for any sign of other reincarnates without luck...

... until now.
