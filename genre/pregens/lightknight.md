Regan knows -- and has made mistakes with -- everybody.
She's a townie, 1/100th heir to the Carter Mill Estate together with her stuck up sister.
When her stepmom Cordelia threatened to cut her off, she cut her gap year short and declared a major (Comparative Analectical Studies), and everyone thought she was back on track.
Until her destiny called, and a she stabbed a monster from her paintings to death with a shoe.
