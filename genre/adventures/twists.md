Between each adventure, the world changes.

If the princesses have a rank of III+, then their experience of the world is somewhat safe:
they can spend their leisure without villainous interruption, and any problems they experience are petty.
If the princesses have a rank of I or 0, then chaos reigns.
Their friends betray them, people oppose them, and everyone is worried.

This doesn't mean that the enemy is more or less powerful!

Remember, roll the princess' **rank** (or choose):

#### 1-3: A friend betrays the princesses or is hurt (by enemy action?).

Then roll 1d (or choose):

1. Cinnibar's had a fire and she needs a few thou to cover bills
2. Abeni's Farm's chickens are being preyed on by foxes
3. Ms. Carter's driver Marcy shows up during your next investigation (bug on phone).
4. Ms. Isaacs offers extra credit to anyone participating in her genealogy study, and you're failing chem 101
5. Dean Byron gives your secret study room to a local gaming group (The Poly Hedras)
6. Jupes Stannes (your RA) is concerned about your hours, and has started trailing you


#### 4-5: Someone picks a fight with the princesses or their friend (why?).

Then roll 1d (or choose):

1. L.S.Lander's blog asked for anyone to share stories of the Hartshorn Hags -- you're worried it's you! 
2. Ms. Isaacs' Skeptics Meetup has brought Onyxxx to town, hunting for the supernatural
3. Cinnibar's fwb Crash steals your supplies thinking they're drugs
4. Dean Byron hires new security which are suspicious of midnight hijinks
5. Townies Against Gownies is picketing your new job for hiring you
6. The bank is trying to foreclose on Abeni's Farm and has sent Mr. Flint to assess value

#### 6: A nasty rumor starts about the princesses or their friend (who started it? is it true?).

Then roll 1d (or choose):

1. Gabby Bitts died in her dorm, and Jupes is now being blamed for the death by the director of res life.
2. Becka Stubbs accuses you of plagiarising your anthro paper from hers (you didn't)
3. Dean Byron has heard you snuck into the Zodiacal Light ruins and puts you on probation (did you?)
4. Dean Byron/Ms. Isaacs accuse of you of spying on DB/MI for MI/DB.
5. Townies against Gownies accuses you (specifically) of starting the fire at Cinnibars' and killing a vagrant
6. Ms. Abeni/Ms. Carter accuses you of distracting her daughter from her duties.

#### 6,6 : Someone unexpected asks the princesses for an inconvenient favor (what will change?).
1. Onyxxx needs help tracking down a stolen amulet, and Cinnabar suggests you.
2. L.S.Lander wants deep background on the Moon Maiden, and knows you collect that kind of thing.
3. Ms. Danvers' birthday is coming up, and her party planner gives you the willies
4. Carter's driver Marcy shows up with a gunshot wound, wants help setting someone up.
5. Dean Byron voluntells you to clean the back stacks -- but they're haunted by The Swotter
6. Ms. Abeni wants her daughter to observe a religious fast.
