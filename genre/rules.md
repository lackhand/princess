Using the questionnaire, different games will adapt game rules differently, in ways specific to your table and your story. For instance:

# Harm & Defiance

> We want to avoid gore, so we'll use general harm categories _beaten, singed, empty, lost, sick, wrong,_ (maybe some others).
> We're avoiding anything graphic and we're tough, so **defiance** should completely eliminate consequences.

# Memory & Decrees
> **Memory** scenes should primarily recollect past lives in Alembic (otherwise we'd weaken the past life thing).  
> **Decrees** are fine only in places touched by the Dream, where coincidence acts up.

# Princess Attributes & Traits
> The princesses each have 3 points to split between **Danger**, **Intrigue** and **Charm**; they'll start at **Rank** 2.
> Each princess has the _memories of alembic_ secret (or a substitute) and _magical transformation_.
>
> Each princess chooses 3 _keys_, 2 _fictional traits_, and 1 _secret_ for her modern-day life.
> Each princess' past life as an alchemical knight gives her 1 more _fictional trait_ and 1 more _secret_.

# Second Season When?
> We don't expect the game's power level to change so **Rank** will just float back towards 2 when major goals are accomplished.
> But we'll reevaluate after Cordy gets resolved, because it might be nice to do a timeskip and let things develop.
