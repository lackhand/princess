It's good to build your game and your princesses together.
This process of getting on the same page produces a "genre", the expectations for the story you'll tell.
Use these sample questions (and answers) to begin:

What's our tone going to be?
> Cartoony action-adventure. PG-13. No sex on screen.
> Definitely we do want romance and love and adult themes!

What's the pitch?
> We attend a small college in a Twin Peaks-esque town.
> We dream of a city of blazing glass.
> We're the reincarnated Alchemical Knights who fight evil through our geeky hobbies, ancient memories, transformation magic, and the power of friendship.
> We're being hunted the Burnt, our shared nightmare.

What's the myth?
> Once upon a time Alembic was the heart of The Empire of Two Skies.
> It was shattered when the dark Queen Theophrasta conjured The Burn.
> The Dawn Empress wished too late that her fallen knights could restore the light
> but Alembic was destroyed,  
> and there were a thousand thousand years of dreaming darkness.
> We remember our failure.

What's the setting? What are some hooks?
> Hartshorn U is a liberal arts college of a thousand students in Danvers Mass, specializing in history and legend.
> It has a reputation for suicide in the local gorge, ghostly hauntings by The Moon Maiden, and witch burnings as recently as 1910.
> Parcel the talking cat is our mentor & connection to the Dream of Alembic,
> Ms Isaacs a new chemistry teacher we don't trust,
> Dean Byron is the scandal-haunted dean of the college,
> Cinnibar a theoretical magician and tea-witch,
> and Jupes Stannes a surprisingly well-connected RA.
> There's been a recent spate of breakins and thefts that L.S.Lander reports are linked to the Bonebrothers ash-dealers and graffiti hatespeech against "all embic" students;
> crisis counseling available at the Stonewall Center.

Who is the enemy? What do they want? What is their plot?
> The Burn is a currently-unconscious disembodied evil parallel dimension that wants to consume everything.
> Seventy years ago, the Zodiacal Light coven made a terrible error and called up The Burn's high priestess Queen Theophrasta, with the survivors forming the core of her new Burned army.
> They quickly began building armies in The Dream and corrupting agents in The World.
> Ten years ago, Theophrasta's General Leogox falsely seduced and Burned the first awakened Alchemical Knight, creating the half-mad Cordy(ceptyrant) from The Moon Maiden.
> Today, Cordy is searching for Parcel the cat under orders from her beloved Leogox to find relics from Alembic in the world.

What does magic look like?
> The world is similar to ours with a magical conspiracy such that all magic-using organizations are cults, secretive, or small.
> Normal people can attune to magic: sense its effects, influence chance, attempt alchemy, or speak prophecy.
> "Gifted" children have a higher special-effects budget: becoming subtle-bodied, manipulating candleflame, grasping spirits, intuition, etc.
> These make good _secrets_!
> Witches, mutants, alchemical knights etc build on that and have superheroic special-effects: mind reading, invsibility, intangibility, pyrokinesis, evocation, etc.
> Inhuman forces from magical spirits to apocalyptic celestials are responsive to celestial rituals.

What have we decided to exclude (keep this updated!)?
> We're all the good guys. We don't kill people, torture, make bank, ...
> Nothing graphic, spiders, nihilism, unpunished cruelty, nothing bad happens to kids/pets, ...

How are we going to tune our game rules?
> The Burn is seductive and anyone could be its agent, so things should feel dark and dangerous.  
> However, we're avoiding anything graphic and we're tough, so **defiance** should completely eliminate consequences.  
> We want to avoid gore, so we'll use general harm categories _beaten, singed, empty, lost, sick, wrong,_ (maybe some others).
> **Memory** scenes should be used mostly for our past lives in Alembic (otherwise we'd weaken the past life thing).  
> **Decrees** are fine only in places touched by the Dream, where coincidence acts up.
>
> The princesses each have 3 points to split between **Danger**, **Intrigue** and **Charm**; they'll start at **Rank** 2.
> Each princess has the _memories of alembic_ secret (or a substitute) and _magical transformation_.
>
> Each princess chooses 3 _keys_, 2 _fictional traits_, and 1 _secret_ for her modern-day life.
> Each princess' past life as an alchemical knight gives her 1 more _fictional trait_ and 1 more _secret_.
> It's ok if you can't come up with this all up-front; just do what makes sense and figure the rest out in play.
>
> We don't expect the game's power level to change so **Rank** will just float back towards 2 when major goals are accomplished.
> But we'll reevaluate after Cordy gets resolved, because it might be nice to do a timeskip and let things develop.

> So the above definitely creates a lot of hooks to hang a character off of: there's drama, people, enemies, and lots and lots of nouns.
