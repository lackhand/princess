It's good to build your game and your princesses together.
This process of getting on the same page produces a "genre", the expectations for the story you'll tell.
Use these sample questions (and answers) to begin:

What's our primary and secondary genre?
> Action-adventure. Romance. Fantasy. Monster of the week. YA fiction.

What's our MPAA rating, or tone?
> PG-13. Cartoon violence, no sex on screen, will contain romance and love and adult themes!

What's the hook?
> We attend a liberal arts college in a Twin Peaks-esque town.
> We dream of a city of blazing glass.
> We're the reincarnated Alchemical Knights who fight evil through our geeky hobbies, ancient memories, transformation magic, and the power of friendship.
> We're being hunted the Burnt, our shared nightmare.

What's the myth?
> Once upon a time Alembic was the heart of The Empire of Two Skies.
> It was shattered when the dark Queen Theophrasta conjured The Burn.
> The Dawn Empress wished too late that her fallen knights could restore the light
> but Alembic was destroyed,  
> and there were a thousand thousand years of dreaming darkness.
> We remember falling.

What's the setting? What are some hooks?
> Tortimock Academy (TortA) is a liberal arts college of a thousand students in Danvers Mass, specializing in history and legend.
> It has a reputation for suicide in the local gorge, ghostly hauntings by The Moon Maiden, and witch burnings as recently as 1910.
> Behind it is the Dream, an allusive and magical realm inhabited by magical creatures at war with, or serving, The Burn (also a region of control in the Dream).
> Parcel the talking cat is our mentor & connection to the Dream,
> Mr Figgis a new chemistry teacher we don't trust,
> Dean Byron is the scandal-haunted dean of the college,
> Cinnibar a theoretical magician and tea-witch,
> and Jupes Stannes a surprisingly well connected RA.
> There's been a recent spate of breakins and thefts that LS.Lander reports are linked to the Bonebrothers ash-dealers and graffiti hatespeech against "all embic"s;
> crisis counseling available at the Stonewall Center.

Who is the enemy? What do they want? What is their plot?
> The Burn is a currently-unconscious disembodied evil force that wants to spread (and by doing, convert everything to dull ash).
> Seventy years ago, the Zodiacal Light coven made a terrible error and called up The Burn's high priestess Queen Theophrasta, with the survivors forming the core of her new Burned army.  
> They quickly began building armies in The Dream and corrupting agents in The World.  
> Ten years ago, Theophrasta's General Leogox falsely seduced and Burned the first awakened Alchemical Knight, creating the half-mad Cordy(ceptyrant) from The Moon Maiden.  
> Today, Cordy is searching for Parcel the cat under orders from her beloved Leogox to find relics from Alembic in the world. 

How does magic work?
> Where the world is thin, magic seeps in from the Dream.
> Any sensitive person can see visions, commune with spirits, lay karmic curses, hypnotize, or use other limited paranormal effects (collectively called glamour).
> Practice, training, and strange rituals can allow a lucky and gifted sensitive to learn arcana, more dramatic powers.
> Apocalyptic celestials, magical spirits and shades, monstrous chimeras, witches, alchemical knights; all have arcana.
> Anyone who follows the steps of a mystical ritual can summon or manipulate such a being or their energies (in weird, dark, and dangerous ways).
> Anyone can use magical science such as alchemy or thaumaturgy can produce effects that are similar but more limited, safer, and slower.

What have we decided to exclude (keep this updated!)?
> We're all the good guys. We don't kill people, torture, make bank, ...
> Nothing graphic, spiders, nihilism, unpunished cruelty, nothing bad happens to kids/pets, ...

How are we going to tune our game rules?
> The Burn is seductive and anyone could be its agent, so things should feel dark and dangerous.  
> However, we're avoiding anything graphic and we're tough, so defiance should completely eliminate consequences.  
> We want to avoid gore, so we'll use general harm categories "beaten", "burned", "empty", "lost", "sick", "wrong", (maybe some others).
> Memory scenes should *only* be to our past lives in Alembic (otherwise we'd weaken the past life thing).  
> It's ok to "memory" in a single line of dialogue or action though ("yeah I brought a screwdriver").  
> Decrees are fine only in places touched by the Dream, where coincidence acts up.

{:.aside}
> So the above definitely creates a lot of hooks to hang a character off of: there's drama, people, enemies, and lots and lots of nouns.
