What's our tone going to be?
> Cartoony action-adventure. PG-13. No sex on screen.
> Definitely we do want romance and love and adult themes!

What's the pitch?
> We attend a small college in a Twin Peaks-esque town.
> We dream of a city of blazing glass.
> We're the reincarnated Alchemical Knights who fight evil through our geeky hobbies, ancient memories, transformation magic, and the power of friendship.
> We're being hunted the Burnt, our shared nightmare.

What's the myth?
> Once upon a time Alembic was the heart of The Empire of Two Skies.
> It was shattered when the dark Queen Theophrasta conjured The Burn.
> The Dawn Empress wished too late that her fallen knights could restore the light
> but Alembic was destroyed,  
> and there were a thousand thousand years of dreaming darkness.
> We remember our failure.

What's the setting? What are some hooks?
> Hartshorn U is a liberal arts college of a thousand students in Danvers Mass, specializing in history and legend.
> It has a reputation for suicide in the local gorge, ghostly hauntings by The Moon Maiden, and witch burnings as recently as 1910.
> Parcel the talking cat is our mentor & connection to the Dream of Alembic,
> Ms Isaacs a new chemistry teacher we don't trust,
> Dean Byron is the scandal-haunted dean of the college,
> Cinnibar a theoretical magician and tea-witch,
> and Jupes Stannes a surprisingly well-connected RA.
> There's been a recent spate of breakins and thefts that L.S.Lander reports are linked to the Bonebrothers ash-dealers and graffiti hatespeech against "all embic" students;
> crisis counseling available at the Stonewall Center.

Who is the enemy? What do they want? What is their plot?
> The Burn is a currently-unconscious disembodied evil parallel dimension that wants to consume everything.
> Seventy years ago, the Zodiacal Light coven made a terrible error and called up The Burn's high priestess Queen Theophrasta, with the survivors forming the core of her new Burned army.
> They quickly began building armies in The Dream and corrupting agents in The World.
> Ten years ago, Theophrasta's General Leogox falsely seduced and Burned the first awakened Alchemical Knight, creating the half-mad Cordy(ceptyrant) from The Moon Maiden.
> Today, Cordy is searching for Parcel the cat under orders from her beloved Leogox to find relics from Alembic in the world.

What does magic look like?
> The world is similar to ours with a magical conspiracy such that all magic-using organizations are cults, secretive, or small.
> Normal people can attune to magic: sense its effects, influence chance, attempt alchemy, or speak prophecy.
> "Gifted" children have a higher special-effects budget: becoming subtle-bodied, manipulating candleflame, grasping spirits, intuition, etc.
> These make good _secrets_!
> Witches, mutants, alchemical knights etc build on that and have superheroic special-effects: mind reading, invsibility, intangibility, pyrokinesis, evocation, etc.
> Inhuman forces from magical spirits to apocalyptic celestials are responsive to celestial rituals.

What have we decided to exclude (keep this updated!)?
> We're all the good guys. We don't kill people, torture, make bank, ...
> Nothing graphic, spiders, nihilism, unpunished cruelty, nothing bad happens to kids/pets, ...
