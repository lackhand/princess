title: Dawn Abeni, Daughter of Time
section: "3.1"
---

Dawn Crier, Blade of the Southern Choir, lived before the stars changed.
She remembers visiting the City of Glass when the Dawn Empress awarded her a golden laurel for her valor.
She remembers the silence of her village in the purple dusk.
She remembers her quarry's lizard-stink, its mobile neck, the horror of its gaze.

She doesn't know why or how she woke up outside of Danvers, but has spent the last five years with Melanie and Parcel building a new life on the Abeni Farm, devoted to a single cause: avenging her fallen world.
