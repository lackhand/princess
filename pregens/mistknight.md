title: Regina Carter, the Knight of Mist
section: "3.3"
---

Regina is one of the bluebloods of Danvers Mass, 1/100th heir to the Carter Mill Estate together with her little sister.
Her life-plan was straightforward: prelaw at Hartshorn, law at a big 10, associate, marriage, partner (big law), child, managing partner, philanthropist.
But she answered the call of destiny to oppose the Burning with her sharp wits and tongue.

In her past life, she was Hydropheria, mistwatcher of the north, guardian of the waterways and keeper of time.
